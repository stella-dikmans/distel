#design studio III

## my journey so far

this term has been all about process and exploration, which I have been implementing very literally. I co-facilitated various design interventions that were all related to the emerging design spaces and my personal- as well as state-of-the-art weak signals. my first concrete idea was related to (drinking) water and the unequal distribution of this vital source across the globe.

right at the beginning of the course I wrote a letter of intent in which I stated that I wanted my practice to work towards “an equal distribution of the impacts of climate change and expansive responses to them by fueling the multiplicity of more-than- human narrations. this is all the same place, one world with all its differences and human and non-human organisms that are equally worth protecting and thriving. I observe that political discourses are stuck in their monophonic stories and easily lose sight of essential needs such as access to clean air, drinking water, and balanced nutrition”. reflecting on it now, after two months of exploring impact and implementation, I can say that this is what I have been working towards all along and that my ambitions still and even more revolve around the power of storytelling and contextualization.

however, I could not meet my own expectation of focusing my interests and developing concrete directions. it were the non-focused and multi-directional practices that expanded my comfort zone and challenged me in constructive ways. I now feel that I have a broader tool and reference box to draw from. I hope that next semester I will be able to combine both approaches and find satisfaction and (self-)realisation in the processes that arise from the contexts I will find myself in.

three take-aways from the last term

1.	think about how to integrate more-than-human entities into the MDEFs concept of “community”

2.	allowing myself to focus on what’s interesting to me, also if this is linked to non-material things such as poetry and writings

3.	record, reflect and document (structured and consistently) the emerging situationships

the first interventions I co-facilitated were broad and related to multi-species collaborations and integrative design processes. as events unfolded, I realized that I am not interested in multispecies design practices per se. I see my agency more in creating spaces, in curating spaces where the voices of multiple species can resonate in. I am interested in disrupting the monophony of futures and in the potential of storytelling as a tool for speculation. rather than designing futures that will always remain unpredictable, I see strength in fictional and collaborative processes that decenter the (human)self. relating this to my project idea about water, my next interventions could deal with a gathering of stories about, with and from water as an actant in the complex network of the planet's cycles. I organized a visit to **[Aigües de Barcelona](https://www.amb.cat/web/ecologia/aigua/instalacions-i-equipaments/detall/-/equipament/edar-del-prat-de-llobregat/276285/11818)** in Llobregat del Prat which will finally happen in the following week. furthermore, with my friend and colleague Myrto, we are participating in a conference about the potentialities of speculative fiction in educational context at the **[Disseny Hub Barcelona](https://esbrina.eu/es/portfolio/imaginar-mundos-posibles-potencialidades-limites-y-fricciones-de-la-ficcion-especulativa-en-la-investigacion-y-la-educacion-2/)**. Both are steps in the right direction and I am excited about what’s will evolve out of these events.
