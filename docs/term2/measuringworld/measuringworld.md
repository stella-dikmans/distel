#measuring the world

`with Oscar, Josep, Victor and Guillem`

this course introduces is to information and data and what they mean and do not mean. it is another meaning making experience in which wse aim to design tools that will measure, translate and expose us to everyday data flying up and around. what are our analogue and digital activities and what does their trackings communicate, represent? we are dealing with the sourcing of data-driven infrastructures. 

when we dont pay for the product, are we becoming the product? 

the internet is bassed on our data - WE are date

informationo vs. data? 

two ways to collect data. 

human readable or machine readable? 

made for machines to be read by machines. how can we access online data and make it visible?
what is an API? searching for **[data](https://api.smartcitizen.me/)**. it means, application programming interface (API). the tools we will learn here, will be rearch tools. we will be able to scroll through the internet, the data tha is out there and then filter, collect, gather information that we actually search for.

**[web scraping](https://hackmd.io/EFtARnSMRLW-db4RJrB_hQ?view)**: each data source has their own way of communication. you have to handle the differences in that. the simplest way is to use phython. 

## monitoring mdef's physical learning experience

again, documentation is all, how to acccess, link and download the data from various smart citizen kids around the world, is explained very well by people having done **[this before](https://docs.smartcitizen.me/Resources/Tutorials/Configure%20Orange%20Data%20Analysis/#steps-for-installing)**. understanding the software (orange) to analyze and vizualize the smart citizen data in comprehensible ways, with the help of **[orange workflows](https://orangedatamining.com/workflows/Scatter-Plot/)**.

we installed ourself two kids, the **[mdef room](https://smartcitizen.me/kits/16118)** and the **[mdef reference point](https://smartcitizen.me/kits/16119)**. and then we are collecting data from a third kit that is installedd near the beach named **[Pati Cientific](https://smartcitizen.me/kits/11038)**.

we made a **[hack md](https://hackmd.io/563RCS8SQWGBG-ieNqbuBg)** to document our process.

The 3 points data was merged and converted to charts, so we could compare the parameters that are important for sensing the ambient quality of the rooms, those were:

    Light
    Noise
    CO2
    Temperature
    TVOC
    PM 1.0
    PM 2.5
    eCO2
    Humidity

References:

TVOC: Total volatile organic compounds is a grouping of a wide range of organic chemical compounds to simplify reporting when these are present in ambient air or emissions. Many substances, such as natural gas, could be classified as volatile organic compounds (VOCs).

PM: Stands for particulate matter: the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye.

eCO2: Equivalent CO2 is the concentration of CO2 that would cause the same level of radiative forcing as a given type and concentration of greenhouse gas. Examples of such greenhouse gases are methane, perfluorocarbons, and nitrous oxide.

    Here the images of the charts:

    MDEF room: Parameter (1)
    Reference IAAC room: Parameter (2)
    Beach: Parameter (3)
