### about me

my name is Stella (she/her), I am a German-Dutch who grew up in Berlin. I am aware of the ongoing environmental changes and climate catastrophes that our societies are confronted with to unprecedented degrees. therefore, this is the constant background music to my practice.

#

as a sociologist, artist and architectural thinker, I am convinced that the thorough study of how human and non-human structures learn and unlearn will feed into our understanding of how they are embedded in a global ever-changing environment - and how possible reactions to these changes could look like.

#

I have learned that exchange and discussion open up (new) possibilities for seeing and thinking; recognizing and developing discourses together promotes heterogeneous coexistences. for me, creating social spaces means imagining collective solutions to global challenges.
