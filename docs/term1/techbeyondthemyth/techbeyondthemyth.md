# tech beyond the myth

`with Santi Fuentemilla, Eduardo Chamorro, Josep MartÃ­, Guillem Camprodon, Ã“scar GonzÃ¡lez and Victor BarberÃ¡n`

*undoing, unwrapping, unmythodologizing the blackboxes we live with..*

we were spending these days from morning till late in the afternoon with this group of energetic, skilled and very patient men in IAAC to a point I come to actually like the idea of IAAC as a home (for the moment at least). never being left alone, Victor always took the time to sit and figure out some cable rewiring and celebrated each lightening LED with us. it were very practical days, of dealing with electronic-waste and redefining and remaking its functions into something valuable. we were *tinkering* about open-end experiences with electronics, we were experimenting with thought-worlds around inputs and outputs or reversed it all. we disintegrated systems and created new contexts for reintegration.

the main aim of this course seemed to me to emancipate us from the dependence on monophonic narratives around technological devices. Instead of presenting Iphones, computers and smoothie makers as complex and difficult machines, we were presented with the idea of simple interdependencies that can be traced back along their production lines with all their various producers in all their various producing-areas, finally ending in the big five who own the world. we learned about how to use open software and hardware tools to change the way technologies work and interface with the world.
here, I present some notes that will eventually resonate in my artistic practices.

##engaging with techmyths in groups
*the design principles of tinkering are honesty, simplicity, uselessness, and processes-orientation*

our group dealt with materials from two laptop screens: there were screens that turned out to be various layers of fascinating plastic sheets, there were speakers and LEDs whose workings we tried to understand  through an Arduino re-integration.

we made order and understood the functions. then we made disorder to twist our presumptions


our research: **[forensic report](https://hackmd.io/6Gz_caxaSM-UFo9HLMk4tw?view)**

then, we twisted things up, we used the LED (prior a light output) as a sensor (now a light input), we connected the speaker to it and uploaded some crazy sounds that varied according to the strength of the light sensed by the LED.

our final presentation: **[presentation slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1UuifmINanKRIw0twBQW5todFrPAJpnrl0AvaipvpT_0/edit#slide=id.g191fca68237_0_0)**

our ghost machine senses the activity that are not visual to the human eye in rooms of various purposes. a polarized glove allows its wearer to be the channel of energies roaming around freely in air and non-air. with the aid of lightwaves, outer-human existences are communicating and are stating their presence in the betweens.


##audiovisual documentation

we also made a short **[movie](https://vimeo.com/773159561?embedded=true&source=vimeo_logo&owner=107341955)**
