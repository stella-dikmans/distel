# extended intelligences

`with Taller Estampa, Lucas Lorenzo Pena and Ramon Sanguesa`

*where does an idea start, and where does an AI end?*

during this extensive two week course, we talked about intelligence(s) and creativity and how the two of them can enhance each other. we discussed on processes on learning and teaching and whether artificial intelligences can be defined as autonomous entities or whether they are an subjective reflection and eventually an extension of the I. these are the grounds for designing with/for/by AI in the current and future world conditions. the aim of this course is to understand the conceptual basis of AI and how the practice of AI-design has produced not only a richness of new possibilities, but also new methods. we were introduced to Poshuman, Postdigital, Smart Interaction and Multiple Intelligence (or chamanistic) design are explored and the basis of their methodologies.
next to that we were practically introduced to the notebook-world and dived into the recognition-and creation-skills of computer generation(s).
here, I present my notes that will eventually resonate in my artistic practices.

##DYIosaurus

`with Korbi, Ahmed, Claudia, Myrto and Amanda`

based on our learnings, we worked as a team on a online application that will eventually inspire users to make usable-objects themselves instead of buying them on the market. similarly to the idea of google-lense, the DYIosaurus will be fed with images, photos from ones phones, and will spit out instructions of how to build, make, create the object on the images. due to a personal account, our service provides the user with available materials and techniques that were chosen according to the geo-social context, the monetary access the user has.
the ethical impact came a bit short when we started (theoretically) applying our service with personified accounts, tracking ones skill-levels and the localization part, providing information about local material and techniques related to the desired object in building.

in our presentation they are more detailed information about how we imagine the DYIosaurus: **[presentation slides](https://drive.google.com/file/d/184Cd-Xiug8Q97-E9UmpPu0RpM6Ush5v9/view?usp=share_link)**
