# welcome to the atlas of weak signals

`with Mariana Quintero and Jose Luis de Vicente`

as a transversal and ongoing project of the MDEF, the Atlas of Weak Signals is a tool and a space to help us navigate and position ourselves in the complex situations in which we operate. it aims to find design and intervention contexts and opportunities that do not only consider and doubt the systemic crises dictating the way we live in the present but show spheres of agency and hope for futures. the atlas considers the complex panorama of our present as well as future challenges and helps to disclose and create opportunities for design interventions. Jose Luis de Vicente introduced in a **[first lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmKsSWLvTms)** the presents we have to tackle and practices that deal with them in future-oriented ways.
the aim of this course is to introduce the toolkit that constitute the ongoing Atlas.

## what weak signals can tell us

*looking closely. imagining widely.*

weak signals are indicators to identify a change in the future with little or no impact on the present, but with the potential to lead to the identification of major impact events. they set trends and indicate certain directions and by that draw up future scenarios. investigating *weak signals* enables a practical approach to navigate and understand possible emerging scenarios. it facilitates seeking opportunities, threats, challenges and shared visions for innovation, policymaking, intervention, research, and business opportunities in the future.

the atlas itself is a *card set*, a toolkit designed by Mariana Quintero. it provides a structure to design a space to move and position oneself in. in order to facilitate the card *game*, the three card types are arranged and one choses two **weak-signal-cards**, one **areas-of-opportunty-card** and two **random-trigger-cards**. the combination and correlations between these cards then form the **design space** in which actions can take place.

## personal weak signals and playing the game
to get used to these cards and the idea of the active creation of a *desing space*, we do not restrict ourselves to the randomness neither the limitations in amount of chosen cards, but consciously look at all the cards and choose those that appeal to us. Also do we skip the random-trigger-cards because these are aimed to give an additional challenge to the question one tries to find solutions for when *playing* the game.

**my weak signals:** *‚Äúfight Anthropocene conflicts‚Äù, ‚Äútechnology for equality‚Äù, and ‚Äúinter-species collaboration‚Äù.*

**my areas of opportunity:** *‚Äúmulti-scalar thinking‚Äù, ‚Äúenvironmental sensing‚Äù, ‚Äúco-creation‚Äù.*

additionally, I made up some cards that did **not exist** yet but that seem essential to my practice: *‚Äúnarrative creation‚Äù, ‚Äúenvironmental health‚Äù, and ‚Äúuniversal rights‚Äù*

for my high school finals in 2016, I wrote a piece on the potential of the concept and term "Anthropocene" to bring climate change and environmental health to the center of social and political discourses. this was shortly before a 34-member team at the 35th International Geological Congress in Cape Town confirmed the theses on anthropological impacts and its own valid terminology. in 2020, I dealt with the effects of the social environment on one's own environmental attitude in my sociology bachelor's thesis, again investigating with the human being in focus. only at art college, I started to incorporate my *more-than-human* interests into my professional practice. I began reading **Le Guin** and **Haraway** and exhibited an installation at DDW2021 about the fragile but essential importance of Earth‚Äô ‚Äúair‚Äù to living organisms. I am now convinced that humans cannot be the sole center of inquiry, as this would exclude many very potent areas of research. we must think, sense, and investigate on *multiple scales*, which includes observing *non-human narratives* and their experiences. ultimately, climate change and environmental health are *stories* shaped by more than one narrative.

my practice seeks for an *equal distribution* of the impacts of climate change and expansive responses to them by *fueling the multiplicity* of *more-than-human narrations*. I want to learn how to design *balanced relationships* that embody synergies, acknowledging that the interconnected whole is not only the sum of its parts. this is all the same place, one world with all its differences and human and non-human organisms that are equally worth protecting and thriving. I observe that political discourses are stuck in their monophonic stories and easily lose sight of essential needs such as access to clean air, drinking water, and balanced nutrition.

my favorite card in the set is the one about **multi scalar thinking**. walking through the city I found many representations of its impacts. I choose the most literal one to visualize my concerns about pasts, presents, and futures.


## exploring the hyper local

`with Mariana Quintero`

*we are in constant becoming.*

after playing around with the set and its consequential thought-processes, we start to build our first more concrete design space

to follow my sequential ideas, keep an eye on my  **[drifting-process](https://stella-dikmans.github.io/distel/progress/drifting/)** in which I am constantly centering my topic of interest through which I hope to access my broader conceptual interests.

when it comes to contextualizing myself in my environment, I re-realize my interests with water consumption. the tap water in my house tastes strongly of chlorine and in social events I often find myself talking about the best water-filter to install in sinks or bottles. I am impressed by the large number of public wells in the city. I have taken to bike with my empty bottle, saving weight and just stopping whenever I feel the need to drink. I never lived in a city in which water was so easily available. I remember in Berlin a start-up once tried to convince shops and restaurants to allow people to fill up their bottles with tap water without charging them. I think it failed. is it right that I am impressed by the supply of such basic need?

my parents took me and my brother camping in nature from an early age. there was no tap, no socket, the nearest well was a 30-minute walk away I remember the sun burning hot on our backs, the five-liter bottles we tossed around on the way to the well, now heavy and full in our hands so that they hurt the insides of our hands. we knew exactly how best to wash ourselves; we found out that the best technique to wash the dishes without soap (at that time natural soaps were not so common) is to scrub with soil and grasses and then just gently rinse with water while brushing your teeth with the same water.  I also remember buying water to drink at the shop. as a very migraine-prone family, my mother always made sure that we didn't run out of drinking water.  yet, for a family of four at 30 degrees in the shade, it was quite a few liters that we would consume in a day - that is, in a week.
I think I had my first culture shock when I was 16, arriving back from a four month stay in the forests near Chiang Mai, Thailand to my parents‚Äô house in Berlin, Germany. I went to the bathroom and realized for the first time in my life that I had been flushing away my excrements with drinking water. and not only that but by throwing soft-washed paper into the water, I polluted it, so that it meant an enormous effort to filter, clean and treat the water before it could be used again in the tap water system of this city. knowing at the same time about the water grabbing that was going on on the continent of Africa, where people die because of the lack of fresh water while they are walking on top of underground reservoirs. how come that we do this with most self-evidence, without questioning the infiniteness of water that we have been told about? or better, that is just not talked about?
