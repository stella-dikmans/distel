## MOC tour I
`9. may in gothico and el born`

the world is a Museum to Colonization, you just don’t see it. The Museum of Colonization (MOC) is here to help you notice, challenge colonial thought, and dream of decolonial futures. The MOC Tour unravels the colonial history of the city of Barcelona. The Tour takes you on a journey of History decolonization by acknowledging colonization's deep-rooted consequences in the lives of today’s marginalized groups of society. 

the idea of this day is a test. We meet at 2 pm at the cathedral and we have Marielle's parents and two of my friends as '(very critical) audience that can reflect on the coming hours. Everything goes well, I record the talkings and we walk smoothly from stop to stop, presenting our prepared contents. The feedback: it is too long and too much walking. The content is interesting yet it could be less history based as our aim is to give an alternative present, to give insights into pasts and links that are not easily spit out by wikipedia.

There will be interactive activities designed for YOU to help shape US! Like co-building MOC's manifesto, sharing you decolonial visions of the future, and connect with like-minded individuals committed to systemic change.

## more thAn I
`19. june in Akashahub`

“more thAn I” - a collective storytelling. Come join our collaborative storytelling installation, bringing your own thoughts to guide the story. An AI-Language Model will ask the questions while you watch your answers being weaved into the story and projected in real time· Your imaginings will merge with the previous ones and the ones after, forming a fascinating plot.

we hope to create a space for critical engagement with AI-tools and the (social) structures that underlie human-machine interactions and outcomes. What happens if we mix a ‘human collective’ and an ‘artificial’ intelligence? Is it an actual ‘mix’?
