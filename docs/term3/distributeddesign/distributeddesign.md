`with Olga Trevisan and Sally Bourdon`

## what is distributed design and techniques to implement it?

**history of distributed design**

*design thinking:* we are creating something with the user in the back of our minds

*system thinking:* we are 
a design approach that breaks down contexts into smaller pieces
@ Iceberg model by goodman, M., 1997
@ table model by 
here, you start thinking about the materiality of the things you have and the things that compose it. this approach tries to vizualize the things we do not see

*musshroom model:* there is also interconnectiivitty bettween the things that we are producing. in a iceberg model you break things down but you ignore their interdependencies. In the mushroom model instead, things are being brooken down but they do not exost in isolation but stands in relation to other mushrooms/ other thinking

this comes together in the idea of a distributive systems. 
@Kate Raworth (donough model)
the idea here is that we are not just distributing things and its

that developed further into a "new mushroom model" who try to vizualize everything! not just recognizing the parts (table model) or the various systems (mushroom model) but rather vizualize the distributed making, that is held by distributed value, and distributed knowledge and is built on distributed power.
there is interconnectivity within these and they all have interactions with each other.

systemic design is where design thinking, system thinking and distributed design are overlapping!

**what is the [distributed design platform (DDP)](https://distributeddesign.eu/about/)?**

 trying to be a space for young designers to exchange though and work and think about the pluralities of distribution. a global community based in fablab that has members all over the placce within europe 

    DDP has four key-values:
        1. open
        2. collaborate
        3. regenerae
        4. being ecosystemic

 this order makes sense because the prerequisite is being open (foundational), getting involved, then you can collaborate with other kinds of actors and hinking about their power and agency (human and non-human), once you are capable of collaboraing, you are able to take responsibility, to give back, to regenerate (sustaining systems is not enough but we have to regenerate @ancestral wisdoms). And then you can think about a wider context, about the other parts of the value change and be ecosystemic in ways that might not be directly linked to your oown practice.

**what do they actually do?**

supporting your creators (creative talents) and envisioning fuure design practices, giving classes and providing courses and content about how to be a creative talent in the market that exists. 

**what does it mean to distribute making, knowledge, power and value?**

we will deal with understanding values and how we can use values in our design processes and will be working with and about circular communitites

### mushroom model in action

in groups we come up with a service or a product (we chose bread) and do go through the mushroom model with "bread" as object of inquiry.

    Learning skills: it was important to listen and built on the thoughts on the others. 
    through this we came up with a chain of thoughts and ideas that I would not have been able to consrtruct myself. 
    In a second step it was important to comprehend another mushroom-model in such way that I could afterwarsd explain their progress to my team. 

    thus my learning skills in bullet points:
        â€¢ listening
        â€¢ following on other people's thoughts 
        â€¢ comprehending other system-workings in short time
        â€¢ presenting other system-workings to my own team comprehensively

    Dynamics: the five of us were equally engaged in the conversation about bread and its four poles (making, value, knowledge, power)

    Interactions: my group depended on me to give them account on other team's system-workings 
    in the same way that I depended on them to understand what system-workings they were exploring.
