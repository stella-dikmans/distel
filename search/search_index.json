Mollusk and fish corpses washed up on the shores and floated on the water surface of the 840km long river. Scientist from various institutions took water probes and discussed possible causes but it seemed difficult to identify and contextualize what had happened. By the end of September, it seemed agreed upon that the sudden death resulted from a toxin-producing microalga that would kill the life of the river for the coming years. However, the thriving of this algae has multiple causes. A poor water quality due to uncommon high temperatures and a very low water levels encouraged the golden algae (Prymnesium parvum), which was identified by the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in all water samples, to flourish (4, 3, 5). This causes high levels of salinity (1, 4, 5) till the point fish and mollusk organisms could not survive. It is assumed that this large overgrowth of toxic algae is next to the result of the environmental change, linked to industrial pollution, chemical wastes that was dumped into the water at some point of the river and continued to spread with its flow (1, 3, 2, 4, 5). The chemical pollutant could not be identified because the investigations started to late (4, 5). In the field of science, they talk about a failure of governmental communication and collaboration (2, 4, 5). Water samples were sent to laboratories in different countries to help identifying the cause (5). What seems clear to all institutions is that the life in the Oder-river has been disrupted and that it will take years for fishes and mollusks to come back to its banks. But why is the research focus so limited to the restoration of a former state of nature? How is it that, although it is agreed that nature is constantly evolving and adapting, so little research is done on the potential of the newly introduced microorganisms that populate the river from now on? The Oder-river comes from the Czech Republic, passes through Poland and Germany and continues their border till it flows into the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s a flowing water that does not stop neither change its qualities according to the made-up lines nation-states draw upon it. Yet the responsibility over the quality of the water is divided to different authorities which causes an inability to response, the lack of response-ability for environmental conditions like this. Environmental scientist James Lovelock criticized the growing disinterest in global phenomena and interdependencies in biology, where he felt it was so necessary to. Instead of focusing on molecular biology and genetic evolution, the small picture of biology research, scientist should return to seeing the big picture and start contextualizing biological phenomena (6). For Lovelock, the study of life had to be holistic; scientist should approach life as one whole organism rather focusing exclusively on the examinations of molecules and atoms (6). This would open our eyes to the self-regulating forces and feedback-systems of nature and how we can adapt our actions and sciences to them. What is happening in the examination of the Oder-river this summer is an example of science breaking wholeness into pieces and trying to restore a previous environmental state. Yet if there would be a non-human centric approach to the situation, scientist could start looking for collaboration with the more-than-human organisms inhabiting the Oder-river. There is agreement that changing climatic conditions in terms of a warmer atmosphere have also led to the appearance of golden algae. The greenhouse gas effect that helps warming up the Earth is being intensively researched, and one of its solutions is seen in algal growth. In 2007, Lovelock presented a technical proposal to stimulate algal growth, \u201cto draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds that would decrease global heating\u201c(7). Prymnesium parvum has been known since 1985 and its lethal potential has been extensively studied. Using morphological studies and genome sequencing, scientists are finding out about its potential to form and spread viruses. Similar techniques can be used to determine the potential for carbon sequestration and the algae\u2019s purpose in its wider context of a global climatological changes. As a microalga, it \u201cassimilates CO2 during autotrophic growth and produces biomass for various applications, including bioenergy production\u201d(8). The dispute between Poland and Germany about the responsibility of the Oder-disaster, shows how, like the division of land into countries, science\u2019s approach to study specifies, sometimes fails to integrate particular events into wider interdependent phenomena. Instead of blaming each other and trying to find the cause of this environmental disaster in a particular chemical pollutant released by a particular institution or person, scientists could focus on the potential collaboration with this emerging organism and see how the Oder-river could be a potential tool for carbon sequestration and rebalancing the Earth\u2019s biosphere. sources: news reports: (1) https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/8/14/photos-germany-poland-mystery-surrounds-mass-fish-deaths-in-the-oder-river (2) https://phys.org/news/2022-09-germany-mass-fish-deaths-oder.html (3) https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rare-toxic-algae-behind-fish-deaths-river-oder-say-researchers-2022-08-19/ (4) https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62688036 (5) https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/rare-golden-algae-may-have-caused-fish-deaths-in-oder-river-says-minister scientific backing: (6) James E.

Mollusk and fish corpses washed up on the shores and floated on the water surface of the 840km long river. Scientist from various institutions took water probes and discussed possible causes but it seemed difficult to identify and contextualize what had happened. By the end of September, it seemed agreed upon that the sudden death resulted from a toxin-producing microalga that would kill the life of the river for the coming years. However, the thriving of this algae has multiple causes. A poor water quality due to uncommon high temperatures and a very low water levels encouraged the golden algae (Prymnesium parvum), which was identified by the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in all water samples, to flourish (4, 3, 5). This causes high levels of salinity (1, 4, 5) till the point fish and mollusk organisms could not survive. It is assumed that this large overgrowth of toxic algae is next to the result of the environmental change, linked to industrial pollution, chemical wastes that was dumped into the water at some point of the river and continued to spread with its flow (1, 3, 2, 4, 5). The chemical pollutant could not be identified because the investigations started to late (4, 5). In the field of science, they talk about a failure of governmental communication and collaboration (2, 4, 5). Water samples were sent to laboratories in different countries to help identifying the cause (5). What seems clear to all institutions is that the life in the Oder-river has been disrupted and that it will take years for fishes and mollusks to come back to its banks. But why is the research focus so limited to the restoration of a former state of nature? How is it that, although it is agreed that nature is constantly evolving and adapting, so little research is done on the potential of the newly introduced microorganisms that populate the river from now on? The Oder-river comes from the Czech Republic, passes through Poland and Germany and continues their border till it flows into the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s a flowing water that does not stop neither change its qualities according to the made-up lines nation-states draw upon it. Yet the responsibility over the quality of the water is divided to different authorities which causes an inability to response, the lack of response-ability for environmental conditions like this. Environmental scientist James Lovelock criticized the growing disinterest in global phenomena and interdependencies in biology, where he felt it was so necessary to. Instead of focusing on molecular biology and genetic evolution, the small picture of biology research, scientist should return to seeing the big picture and start contextualizing biological phenomena (6). For Lovelock, the study of life had to be holistic; scientist should approach life as one whole organism rather focusing exclusively on the examinations of molecules and atoms (6). This would open our eyes to the self-regulating forces and feedback-systems of nature and how we can adapt our actions and sciences to them. What is happening in the examination of the Oder-river this summer is an example of science breaking wholeness into pieces and trying to restore a previous environmental state. Yet if there would be a non-human centric approach to the situation, scientist could start looking for collaboration with the more-than-human organisms inhabiting the Oder-river. There is agreement that changing climatic conditions in terms of a warmer atmosphere have also led to the appearance of golden algae. The greenhouse gas effect that helps warming up the Earth is being intensively researched, and one of its solutions is seen in algal growth. In 2007, Lovelock presented a technical proposal to stimulate algal growth, \u201cto draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds that would decrease global heating\u201c(7). Prymnesium parvum has been known since 1985 and its lethal potential has been extensively studied. Using morphological studies and genome sequencing, scientists are finding out about its potential to form and spread viruses. Similar techniques can be used to determine the potential for carbon sequestration and the algae\u2019s purpose in its wider context of a global climatological changes. As a microalga, it \u201cassimilates CO2 during autotrophic growth and produces biomass for various applications, including bioenergy production\u201d(8). The dispute between Poland and Germany about the responsibility of the Oder-disaster, shows how, like the division of land into countries, science\u2019s approach to study specifies, sometimes fails to integrate particular events into wider interdependent phenomena.

There are even desalination plants that help make seawater drinkable for humans. here, citizens consume about 122 liters of fresh drinking water every day. most of it is used to wash clothes and flush away excrement. in parts of the world where infrastructures are not so well developed and political and economic authorities are not so concerned about an even distribution of water resources to their citizens, a daily consumption of 10-15 liters of water is not exceptional. in these areas, fresh water is mainly used for drinking and washing one\u2019s body. according to international health organizations, a person who has access to less than 40 liters of fresh water per day is considered water poor. so if we consume 122 liters of water, of which only 2 liters at most enter our bodies directly through drinking, and are unaware of where the other 120 liters go, this seems problematic in view of the increasing scarcity of freshwater resources globally. engagements and limits: creating awareness about well-established patterns and habits is not easy. especially not when the impacts are not directly felt but outsourced to distant places. therefore, engagement must happen in closed environments in which impact is created, seen, and can be followed. a possible example would be the creation of a working-bubble (Valldaura labs?) in which a water cycle is represented as an interdependent unit within global climatological systems. this bears its limits because it created a reality that is not directly linked to the reality urban dwellers live in. theory of change: structural change is always hard to inspire because it asks for infrastructural and habitual transformations that are time and thought intensive. yet habitual changes often come by changes in convictions and realizations about newly discovered knowledges. here, changes occur when trends become mainstream, when things are figured out and a path is mapped out. a dominant theory of change might approach transition to conscious water consumption with the idea of measure, control, change. in this case it has its limits as we experience that measuring and controlling water consumption in the city context is almost impossible. living with the infrastructure of the homes and of the entities visited in cities, fresh water is used very often unconscious and out of habit. therefore, I propose to prototype cultures that deal with water consciously. having examples (like a Valldaura lab bubble) of how conscious water consumption could work inspires, motivates, and shows that the unthinkable is actually possible. design challenges and opportunity: challenges: \u2022 pre-made infrastructures in houses and water-resource management \u2022 knowledge about what freshwater is and what it means to the global ecosystem \u2022 attention to individual usage of water \u2022 habits of using fresh-water with the thought of it being endlessly renewed \u2022 \u2026 opportunities: \u2022 increased water scarcity on a global scale (increased media attention) \u2022 droughts on a local scale led to water restrictions in the city; in other parts floodings on a local scale led to the destruction of all kinds of essential infrastructures in cities \u2022 the consequences of the lack of access to fresh water are easily perceived as a major threat \u2022 water is a renewable resource, and its cycle is made visible relatively easy in DIY experiments \u2022 \u2026","title":"community engagement"},{"location":"term1/communityengagement/communityengagement/#_1","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 8 / 22 - 26 November 2022","title":""},{"location":"term1/communityengagement/communityengagement/#community-engagement","text":"with Markel Cormenzana and Merce Rua from HOLON in Casa Batllo this course aims to show how the design practice and the role of the designer has been evolving over time. instead of seeing our work as a service (design over), or as a means to satisfy users needs (design for), design practices today deal with the agency of all involved throughout the process (design with). with this frame in mind we talked about creative communities and the potentialities of transitioning. but mainly this week was a week full of exploring design . eventually we talked about the responsibility of providing spaces that enable, allow, and support the meeting . we talked about the intersection of fields and species, of research and experiences; the places where traditions manifest their roots in new soils. we talked about creating dialogues in various ways. creating dialogues in a) affirmative or b) critical ways.

It is structured in three terms of which this is the first. we will learn what it means to design for emergent futures, by analyzing pasts, presents and futures from first-person perspectives. we will look for weak signals and find out how they can have leverage. we will build our identity as designers and reflect on where our strengths lie and where we can have impact. the aim is to develop a critical design practice by the end of the semester that operates in fertile areas of interventions built on mappings, cartographies, experiments, 1 st person design activities and prototypes. \u00b6 prototyping \u00b6 prototyping as a tool for my design practice prototypes can help to capture and visualize data. what role we assign to the prototype is important because the way we prototype will shape our projects and design processes. Oscar Tomico introduced us to four different roles that prototyping can play in design practice and enquiry processes. (1) prototype serves as an experimental component: here a hypothesis is tested (2) prototype serves as a means of inquiry: here an open-minded exploration is performed and the pt is the instrument (3) prototype serves as a research archetype: here the pt serves as an illustration and demonstration to show possible results of the research (4) prototype serves as a directing tool for inquiry: here the making-process (with all involved agents) of the pt is helping to direct the research fast scaling and fast failing are important to the design practice as this is what helps to understand the granularity of situational contexts in which a design intervention is thought to have impact. personal experience with these four roles of prototyping \u00b6 a prototype\u2019s role as a hypothesis tester is in my experience common in scientific and architectural research. at least in social research, we often make up hypothesis and then go on quantitative or qualitative investigations trying to falsify our assumptions. also in architectural design processes, I experienced the theoretical anticipation of certain scenarios and a subsequent practical approach of making small-scale models to test whether the ideas were accurate. for my project on unequal access to water (in terms of quantity and quality) I would like to investigate without prior assumptions. but I can imagine that at certain moments it makes sense to focus on a particular hypothesis and its application. this will help to concentrate the research area. as a mean of inquiry , prototypes were essential to my bachelor-thesis that dealt with the influence of one\u2019s social surrounding on one\u2019s environmental attitude. the qualitative interviews I conducted had a clear guideline, which I adapted depending on the recipient and the situation. I conducted each interview only once and weaved the obtained data into my observations. another social research I implemented was a quantitative survey on the housing situation among art students in Amsterdam. the survey was my tool to obtain the data I was looking for. in both cases, the topic was clear yet there was no outcome assumed. to find out how water is consumed by the inhabitants of Barcelona, I can use prototypes of water filters, water measures etc. to obtain relevant data within a framework yet without prior expectations. Furthermore, I can be the prototype myself to observe patterns in water consumption (regarding quantity and quality). as an archetypal prototype , I once wrote a fictional story about a future in which a virtual object provides the framework for a society that has sterilized themselves to the extent that Earth seems toxic in every sense. building on the data I have received from myself as a prototype, I can also use myself as an archetypal prototype: I can determine the access and the amount of water I have; I can embody what access and consumption looks like in different areas and situational contexts (in Barcelona and beyond), etc.. the last role of prototypes, the one where prototypes serve as vehicles for enquiry , is one that I have probably unconsciously explored a lot. here, the research itself directs the area of exploration. I\u2019m thinking of building fires in nature, cooking when the fridge is empty, sharing beds when there are more people than pillows to sleep on.... here it is the process of making, looking for dry wood under bushes, mixing garlic and honey to make spice, stacking clothes to soften the ground.... All these things lead to observations, to insights that one would never have gained by defining an area of research or asking a question beforehand. the information and interest come while doing, while prototyping ideas. I think that this role also is the most interesting to my still very wide and open project. inequalities regarding water access is widely investigated theoretically and explored in many ways through practical interventions. I would like to explore openly and through a collaborative process with people and more-than-human beings what water means, to me, to others, to structures of inequality. \u00b6 the workspace: my research through design toolbox \u00b6 with Oscar Tomico, Mariana Quintero and Tomas Diez as a professional, we learn to be resilient and resourceful. we conduct research, designing enables us to learn and unlearn, therefore we call this research through design (RdT). whereas as professionals, we try to offer consistency and support, as individuals we grow and we change, we are hybrids that act in everchanging environments. I reflect on my profile more detailed over here: my hybrid profile . what follows, is the trial to map the context in which I see my potentiality thriving. who am I if not the one you see? \u00b6 the I only exist in the context in which the you perceive the me from its subjective context. the context in which I move, shapes me as a professional in the sense that the physical and virtual access points available to me determine my possibilities for collaboration and creation. reflecting on my hyperlocal and hyperconnected design space in which I move physically and virtually, I become aware of what is available to me. in this extended work space , I explore the access to resources I already have and what access I still need to expand my sphere of action in ways that widen its potentiality. with the help of four areas of reflection , I can develop my design space , the current one and the desired future ones; I am thereby augmenting my subjective context. my RtD toolbox \u00b6 based on my ever-changing visions and identities that persist in my hybrid profile areas of reflection: (1) hardware \u2013 this includes the material and things, (2) infrastructure and communities \u2013 this includes people and more-than-human relationships, (3) theoretical contextualization \u2013 these include the guiding forces that shape my beliefs (4) artistic conceptualization \u2013 this includes the sources of inspiration that shape my practice. I hope to make use of this map by applying these resources to navigate actively through my design space of weak signals to follow my sequential ideas, keep an eye on my drifting-process in which I center my topic of interest through which I hope to access my more wider conceptual interests. \u00b6 design interventions \u00b6 with Oscar Tomico having defined the design space in which I move, it was about time to talk about the active engagement in it. we are introduced to design interventions that can come in various shapes and colors. by intervening as designers in our design spaces, we are exploring rather than testing. we aim to start dialogues that evoke imagination and speculation. this deductive approach asks a great deal of reflection as you are constantly drifting around topics and contents\u2026 various methodologies \u00b6 the first-person perspective (1PP) is one of the research through design tools that works as an iterative design intervention. It aims to involve me personally and the embodiment of learning and unlearning. me in action? where it all comes together \u00b6 in my design space of weak signals and my first design space I will initiate my first interventions interventions will occur throughout and nonstop. it is a continuous progress of engaging in collaborative practices. \u00b6 communication strategy \u00b6 with Oscar Tomico and Jana to document and develop an open design process, it needs to be communicated to fellow thinkers and sources of inspiration. this entails having an idea about the role of the communication \u2013 why do I want to communicate the process of my ideation and prototyping processes? and the medium of how this can be communicated best. as an exercise we thought about ways to communicate our current projects as they progress\u2026 my water project evolves along an inductive investigation about narratives on access to fresh water. it aims to reframe commonly held beliefs about the infinite nature of access to freshwater and instead seeks to illustrate the global interdependencies inherent in the (unconscious) use of freshwater and the inequalities of its consequences.

Oscar Tomico introduced us to four different roles that prototyping can play in design practice and enquiry processes. (1) prototype serves as an experimental component: here a hypothesis is tested (2) prototype serves as a means of inquiry: here an open-minded exploration is performed and the pt is the instrument (3) prototype serves as a research archetype: here the pt serves as an illustration and demonstration to show possible results of the research (4) prototype serves as a directing tool for inquiry: here the making-process (with all involved agents) of the pt is helping to direct the research fast scaling and fast failing are important to the design practice as this is what helps to understand the granularity of situational contexts in which a design intervention is thought to have impact.","title":"prototyping"},{"location":"term1/designstudioI/designstudio1/#personal-experience-with-these-four-roles-of-prototyping","text":"a prototype\u2019s role as a hypothesis tester is in my experience common in scientific and architectural research. at least in social research, we often make up hypothesis and then go on quantitative or qualitative investigations trying to falsify our assumptions. also in architectural design processes, I experienced the theoretical anticipation of certain scenarios and a subsequent practical approach of making small-scale models to test whether the ideas were accurate. for my project on unequal access to water (in terms of quantity and quality) I would like to investigate without prior assumptions. but I can imagine that at certain moments it makes sense to focus on a particular hypothesis and its application. this will help to concentrate the research area. as a mean of inquiry , prototypes were essential to my bachelor-thesis that dealt with the influence of one\u2019s social surrounding on one\u2019s environmental attitude. the qualitative interviews I conducted had a clear guideline, which I adapted depending on the recipient and the situation. I conducted each interview only once and weaved the obtained data into my observations. another social research I implemented was a quantitative survey on the housing situation among art students in Amsterdam. the survey was my tool to obtain the data I was looking for. in both cases, the topic was clear yet there was no outcome assumed. to find out how water is consumed by the inhabitants of Barcelona, I can use prototypes of water filters, water measures etc. to obtain relevant data within a framework yet without prior expectations. Furthermore, I can be the prototype myself to observe patterns in water consumption (regarding quantity and quality). as an archetypal prototype , I once wrote a fictional story about a future in which a virtual object provides the framework for a society that has sterilized themselves to the extent that Earth seems toxic in every sense. building on the data I have received from myself as a prototype, I can also use myself as an archetypal prototype: I can determine the access and the amount of water I have; I can embody what access and consumption looks like in different areas and situational contexts (in Barcelona and beyond), etc.. the last role of prototypes, the one where prototypes serve as vehicles for enquiry , is one that I have probably unconsciously explored a lot. here, the research itself directs the area of exploration. I\u2019m thinking of building fires in nature, cooking when the fridge is empty, sharing beds when there are more people than pillows to sleep on.... here it is the process of making, looking for dry wood under bushes, mixing garlic and honey to make spice, stacking clothes to soften the ground.... All these things lead to observations, to insights that one would never have gained by defining an area of research or asking a question beforehand. the information and interest come while doing, while prototyping ideas. I think that this role also is the most interesting to my still very wide and open project. inequalities regarding water access is widely investigated theoretically and explored in many ways through practical interventions. I would like to explore openly and through a collaborative process with people and more-than-human beings what water means, to me, to others, to structures of inequality.","title":"personal experience with these four roles of prototyping"},{"location":"term1/designstudioI/designstudio1/#_3","text":"","title":""},{"location":"term1/designstudioI/designstudio1/#the-workspace-my-research-through-design-toolbox","text":"with Oscar Tomico, Mariana Quintero and Tomas Diez as a professional, we learn to be resilient and resourceful. we conduct research, designing enables us to learn and unlearn, therefore we call this research through design (RdT). whereas as professionals, we try to offer consistency and support, as individuals we grow and we change, we are hybrids that act in everchanging environments.
