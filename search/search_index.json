Mollusk and fish corpses washed up on the shores and floated on the water surface of the 840km long river. Scientist from various institutions took water probes and discussed possible causes but it seemed difficult to identify and contextualize what had happened. By the end of September, it seemed agreed upon that the sudden death resulted from a toxin-producing microalga that would kill the life of the river for the coming years. However, the thriving of this algae has multiple causes. A poor water quality due to uncommon high temperatures and a very low water levels encouraged the golden algae (Prymnesium parvum), which was identified by the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in all water samples, to flourish (4, 3, 5). This causes high levels of salinity (1, 4, 5) till the point fish and mollusk organisms could not survive. It is assumed that this large overgrowth of toxic algae is next to the result of the environmental change, linked to industrial pollution, chemical wastes that was dumped into the water at some point of the river and continued to spread with its flow (1, 3, 2, 4, 5). The chemical pollutant could not be identified because the investigations started to late (4, 5). In the field of science, they talk about a failure of governmental communication and collaboration (2, 4, 5). Water samples were sent to laboratories in different countries to help identifying the cause (5). What seems clear to all institutions is that the life in the Oder-river has been disrupted and that it will take years for fishes and mollusks to come back to its banks. But why is the research focus so limited to the restoration of a former state of nature? How is it that, although it is agreed that nature is constantly evolving and adapting, so little research is done on the potential of the newly introduced microorganisms that populate the river from now on? The Oder-river comes from the Czech Republic, passes through Poland and Germany and continues their border till it flows into the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s a flowing water that does not stop neither change its qualities according to the made-up lines nation-states draw upon it. Yet the responsibility over the quality of the water is divided to different authorities which causes an inability to response, the lack of response-ability for environmental conditions like this. Environmental scientist James Lovelock criticized the growing disinterest in global phenomena and interdependencies in biology, where he felt it was so necessary to. Instead of focusing on molecular biology and genetic evolution, the small picture of biology research, scientist should return to seeing the big picture and start contextualizing biological phenomena (6). For Lovelock, the study of life had to be holistic; scientist should approach life as one whole organism rather focusing exclusively on the examinations of molecules and atoms (6). This would open our eyes to the self-regulating forces and feedback-systems of nature and how we can adapt our actions and sciences to them. What is happening in the examination of the Oder-river this summer is an example of science breaking wholeness into pieces and trying to restore a previous environmental state. Yet if there would be a non-human centric approach to the situation, scientist could start looking for collaboration with the more-than-human organisms inhabiting the Oder-river. There is agreement that changing climatic conditions in terms of a warmer atmosphere have also led to the appearance of golden algae. The greenhouse gas effect that helps warming up the Earth is being intensively researched, and one of its solutions is seen in algal growth. In 2007, Lovelock presented a technical proposal to stimulate algal growth, \u201cto draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds that would decrease global heating\u201c(7). Prymnesium parvum has been known since 1985 and its lethal potential has been extensively studied. Using morphological studies and genome sequencing, scientists are finding out about its potential to form and spread viruses. Similar techniques can be used to determine the potential for carbon sequestration and the algae\u2019s purpose in its wider context of a global climatological changes.

Mollusk and fish corpses washed up on the shores and floated on the water surface of the 840km long river. Scientist from various institutions took water probes and discussed possible causes but it seemed difficult to identify and contextualize what had happened. By the end of September, it seemed agreed upon that the sudden death resulted from a toxin-producing microalga that would kill the life of the river for the coming years. However, the thriving of this algae has multiple causes. A poor water quality due to uncommon high temperatures and a very low water levels encouraged the golden algae (Prymnesium parvum), which was identified by the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in all water samples, to flourish (4, 3, 5). This causes high levels of salinity (1, 4, 5) till the point fish and mollusk organisms could not survive. It is assumed that this large overgrowth of toxic algae is next to the result of the environmental change, linked to industrial pollution, chemical wastes that was dumped into the water at some point of the river and continued to spread with its flow (1, 3, 2, 4, 5). The chemical pollutant could not be identified because the investigations started to late (4, 5). In the field of science, they talk about a failure of governmental communication and collaboration (2, 4, 5). Water samples were sent to laboratories in different countries to help identifying the cause (5). What seems clear to all institutions is that the life in the Oder-river has been disrupted and that it will take years for fishes and mollusks to come back to its banks. But why is the research focus so limited to the restoration of a former state of nature? How is it that, although it is agreed that nature is constantly evolving and adapting, so little research is done on the potential of the newly introduced microorganisms that populate the river from now on? The Oder-river comes from the Czech Republic, passes through Poland and Germany and continues their border till it flows into the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s a flowing water that does not stop neither change its qualities according to the made-up lines nation-states draw upon it. Yet the responsibility over the quality of the water is divided to different authorities which causes an inability to response, the lack of response-ability for environmental conditions like this. Environmental scientist James Lovelock criticized the growing disinterest in global phenomena and interdependencies in biology, where he felt it was so necessary to. Instead of focusing on molecular biology and genetic evolution, the small picture of biology research, scientist should return to seeing the big picture and start contextualizing biological phenomena (6). For Lovelock, the study of life had to be holistic; scientist should approach life as one whole organism rather focusing exclusively on the examinations of molecules and atoms (6). This would open our eyes to the self-regulating forces and feedback-systems of nature and how we can adapt our actions and sciences to them. What is happening in the examination of the Oder-river this summer is an example of science breaking wholeness into pieces and trying to restore a previous environmental state. Yet if there would be a non-human centric approach to the situation, scientist could start looking for collaboration with the more-than-human organisms inhabiting the Oder-river. There is agreement that changing climatic conditions in terms of a warmer atmosphere have also led to the appearance of golden algae. The greenhouse gas effect that helps warming up the Earth is being intensively researched, and one of its solutions is seen in algal growth. In 2007, Lovelock presented a technical proposal to stimulate algal growth, \u201cto draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds that would decrease global heating\u201c(7). Prymnesium parvum has been known since 1985 and its lethal potential has been extensively studied. Using morphological studies and genome sequencing, scientists are finding out about its potential to form and spread viruses. Similar techniques can be used to determine the potential for carbon sequestration and the algae\u2019s purpose in its wider context of a global climatological changes. As a microalga, it \u201cassimilates CO2 during autotrophic growth and produces biomass for various applications, including bioenergy production\u201d(8).

Or in c) acknowledging ways. we talked about worldviews and postures, about what it means to design for more-than-human rather than human. we talked about social capital and what it means to be part of a interdependent net of resources. we talked about facilitating processes that have the potential to enable transition. \u201cfacilitation means to make something easy, to render less difficult, from stem of Latin facilis \u201ceasy to do,\u201d from facere \u201cto do\u201d.\u201d to be the facilitator of a transition means \u201cto provide the infrastructure, process and support necessary to perform a task, but staying out of it.\u201d it means to listen and sensitively direct, manage, introduce and control a space of ideation. as facilitator we design a space in which (ideally) every actant and their thoughts feel included, a space that supports emergence. one of the biggest challenge in facilitating is the emergent nature of the situational contexts with all its different actants. every situation must be approached anew, open to the unknown and the unexpected. this is a challenge but at the same time a opportunity, facilitating is not only a human quality but it is a resources we have access to, but with which we have to deal responsibly, in line with our human restrictions. what is the time I have? what are the energies I can give? a key in dealing with our resources responsibly is preparation. Preparing the meeting as followed: have a good introduction, a beginning, then framing the session and have a reflective closure. it is essential to talk about what happens after, to think about the follow up. engaging in communities - actant map \u00b6 another map to steward the undirectedness the process of mapping out a challenge, interest and point of transition, is essential to include communities and all another agents that are involved, that are related to the topic. before we intervene, engage in a (social) system, we have to understand the (social) capitals at stake. following Bruno Latour , we are using the term actant to describe all participating entities that have agency in a chosen situatioship. transition design a la HOLON \u00b6 Transition Design is a transdisciplinary approach aimed at addressing the many \u2018wicked\u2019 problems confronting 21 st century societies: climate change, forced migration, political and social polarization, global pandemics, lack of access to affordable housing/healthcare/education and many others.

There are even desalination plants that help make seawater drinkable for humans. here, citizens consume about 122 liters of fresh drinking water every day. most of it is used to wash clothes and flush away excrement. in parts of the world where infrastructures are not so well developed and political and economic authorities are not so concerned about an even distribution of water resources to their citizens, a daily consumption of 10-15 liters of water is not exceptional. in these areas, fresh water is mainly used for drinking and washing one\u2019s body. according to international health organizations, a person who has access to less than 40 liters of fresh water per day is considered water poor. so if we consume 122 liters of water, of which only 2 liters at most enter our bodies directly through drinking, and are unaware of where the other 120 liters go, this seems problematic in view of the increasing scarcity of freshwater resources globally. engagements and limits: creating awareness about well-established patterns and habits is not easy. especially not when the impacts are not directly felt but outsourced to distant places. therefore, engagement must happen in closed environments in which impact is created, seen, and can be followed. a possible example would be the creation of a working-bubble (Valldaura labs?) in which a water cycle is represented as an interdependent unit within global climatological systems. this bears its limits because it created a reality that is not directly linked to the reality urban dwellers live in. theory of change: structural change is always hard to inspire because it asks for infrastructural and habitual transformations that are time and thought intensive. yet habitual changes often come by changes in convictions and realizations about newly discovered knowledges. here, changes occur when trends become mainstream, when things are figured out and a path is mapped out. a dominant theory of change might approach transition to conscious water consumption with the idea of measure, control, change. in this case it has its limits as we experience that measuring and controlling water consumption in the city context is almost impossible. living with the infrastructure of the homes and of the entities visited in cities, fresh water is used very often unconscious and out of habit. therefore, I propose to prototype cultures that deal with water consciously. having examples (like a Valldaura lab bubble) of how conscious water consumption could work inspires, motivates, and shows that the unthinkable is actually possible. design challenges and opportunity: challenges: \u2022 pre-made infrastructures in houses and water-resource management \u2022 knowledge about what freshwater is and what it means to the global ecosystem \u2022 attention to individual usage of water \u2022 habits of using fresh-water with the thought of it being endlessly renewed \u2022 \u2026 opportunities: \u2022 increased water scarcity on a global scale (increased media attention) \u2022 droughts on a local scale led to water restrictions in the city; in other parts floodings on a local scale led to the destruction of all kinds of essential infrastructures in cities \u2022 the consequences of the lack of access to fresh water are easily perceived as a major threat \u2022 water is a renewable resource, and its cycle is made visible relatively easy in DIY experiments \u2022 \u2026","title":"community engagement"},{"location":"term1/communityengagement/communityengagement/#_1","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 8 / 22 - 26 November 2022","title":""},{"location":"term1/communityengagement/communityengagement/#community-engagement","text":"with Markel Cormenzana and Merce Rua from HOLON in Casa Batllo this course aims to show how the design practice and the role of the designer has been evolving over time. instead of seeing our work as a service (design over), or as a means to satisfy users needs (design for), design practices today deal with the agency of all involved throughout the process (design with). with this frame in mind we talked about creative communities and the potentialities of transitioning. but mainly this week was a week full of exploring design . eventually we talked about the responsibility of providing spaces that enable, allow, and support the meeting . we talked about the intersection of fields and species, of research and experiences; the places where traditions manifest their roots in new soils. we talked about creating dialogues in various ways. creating dialogues in a) affirmative or b) critical ways.

I conducted each interview only once and weaved the obtained data into my observations. another social research I implemented was a quantitative survey on the housing situation among art students in Amsterdam. the survey was my tool to obtain the data I was looking for. in both cases, the topic was clear yet there was no outcome assumed. to find out how water is consumed by the inhabitants of Barcelona, I can use prototypes of water filters, water measures etc. to obtain relevant data within a framework yet without prior expectations. Furthermore, I can be the prototype myself to observe patterns in water consumption (regarding quantity and quality). as an archetypal prototype , I once wrote a fictional story about a future in which a virtual object provides the framework for a society that has sterilized themselves to the extent that Earth seems toxic in every sense. building on the data I have received from myself as a prototype, I can also use myself as an archetypal prototype: I can determine the access and the amount of water I have; I can embody what access and consumption looks like in different areas and situational contexts (in Barcelona and beyond), etc.. the last role of prototypes, the one where prototypes serve as vehicles for enquiry , is one that I have probably unconsciously explored a lot. here, the research itself directs the area of exploration.

Yet together, we matched a lot of our ideas and came up with the plan to organize a conference ourselves and invite inspiring people that deal in their practice with speculative storytelling. Based of what we read about the Esbrina Research Group conference, we imagined it a fruitful idea to put together various thinkers and let them share their experiences. Then during the Design Dialogue, our mentor Oscar asked me about whether I continued with that application. I denied and realized I could not explain why so in a satisfying way (for me neither him). The next morning, I called Myrto and told her I am about to write a proposal and that I would include her and still apply. A few days later we got a yet and the quest to hand in a paper by the beginning of January and prepare a presentation to share on the conference mid-January.

Starting with the master program, my frustrations were in the ignorance politics of global (economic) infrastructure and the inequal distribution of its consequences. My sociology background made me question the power of power and what it is that makes (us) people so ignorant and disconnected. A topic, that my sociology-thesis dealt with, linking it to environmental attitudes. During my last years in the field of architectural design, my research became more practice oriented, and I realized that it needs a redefinition of global infrastructures towards enabling instead of controlling local dynamics of different societies. It appeared to me that the dependence on one narrative about the future is blinding and disempowering people through a depiction of the unknown as a dangerous insecurity. As in my previous studies also here I soon came to the point of being paralyzed when it comes to breaking things down, focusing on one concrete topic rather than extending my fingers into all directions. Yet this whole term was all about exploring and staying open (framing and exploring perspectives), so for the sake of the exercises I took (fresh) water as an example to visualize and prototype the localities of this resource. I was interested in (fresh) water and the uneven distribution of this vital resource across the globe. I co-created several design interventions, all related to my emerging design space in which certain weak signals appear repeatedly: Anthropocene conflicts, how technology can aid equality, and how collaboration can include more-than-human species. Conceptually I engage with thinkers that write about the importance of storytelling and more-than-human narrations of the realities we oversee. I gain more knowledge about (de)colonialist practices and the ancestral knowledges that (in my reality) are being continuously overwritten by capitalist and eurocentric philosophies. I become interested in multi-species collaboration and what it means to integrate non-human agents into design processes. This I explore through experimenting with listening practices that focus on non-human voices (water), with exploring what it means to be a non-human in the city that tries to access water (24h living-with challenge), with experimenting with water-probing to find out for whom (fresh)water is actually \u201cfresh\u201d and healthy, using artificial intelligence to define water cycles within the city, organizing a visit to the water facilitation center that treats Barcelona\u2019s fresh (and dirty) water ( Aig\u00fces de Barcelona in Llobregat del Prat), and facilitating an experience for others to step out of their human shoes (and into water). Next to my practical exploration, I read about the global politics of (fresh)water cycles, get angry about the practices of water grabbing and get fascinated about the many cultures that personify and value water as its own righteous entity. My design space at this point (design space 02 / 2022) deals with climate consciousness and how a global governance must set guidelines for healthy ecologies on one side yet must allow local contexts to feed out of their histories and built situated realities. As events unfolded, I realized that I am not interested in multispecies-design-practices per se. I see my agency more in creating spaces, in curating spaces where voices can resonate in. I am interested in disrupting the monophony of future(s) and in the potential of storytelling as a tool for speculation. This, all in the sense of human agency and voice. With my sociology education in the back of my head, I am constantly seeing the various (social) realities that are being created through stories and that empower (and disempower) people and more-than-human realities. I see a strength in fictional and collaborative processes that decentre the (human) self by consciously engaging with the bigger contexts we are embedded in. Throughout this journey, my path overlaps with my classmate Myrto\u2019s and we decide to work together. We develop an extensive research about binary-system thinking, post-nature, concepts of transitioning, and speculative fiction. We explored theories such as post-humanism (Timothy Morton, Slavoj Zizek),the mesh (Timothy Morton), anthropocene - capitalocene \u2013 cthulhucene epoch (Donna Haraway, Anna Tsing Lowenhaupt, Bruno Latour), carrier bag (Donna Haraway), the Gaia-theory (James Lovelock) to name a few. Together we built a design space (design space 04 / 2023) that deals with narrative creation, space facilitation for imagination, and methodologies that promote concern and curiosity towards the unknown. We aim to combat a monophonic future in which things remain as they are. Based on that, we created a question-catalogue with which we try to engage a wider public into our conversations and inspire an open dialogue. Overall, my focus remains on narrative (co-)creation and my ambitions still and even more revolve around the power of storytelling and contextualization. My goal is to amplify diverse narratives that include more-than-human perspectives yet are not focused on multispecies collaborations. This aims to combat the political and economical one-sidedness when it comes to addressing essential needs like clean air, water, and nutrition. Having had expectations of focusing my interests and developing concrete directions, I have to say that I am more lost than ever with what I do and where I go. It were the de-centralizing and multi-directional exercises that expanded my comfort zone and challenged me in constructive yet disorienting ways. I might have a broader toolbox to draw from yet there are still a thousand ways I could go, and no tool helps me making decisions more lightly. This is a particular challenge for me, as I derive satisfaction from concrete planning and implementation. Although I experience the benefits of widening and being open to immediate situations, I will try to combine both approaches to find (self-)realisation in the processes that arise from the contexts I find myself in. three take-aways from the last term: 1. think about how to integrate more-than-human entities into the MDEFs concept of \u201ccommunity\u201d 2. allowing myself to focus on what\u2019s interesting to me, also if this is linked to non-material things such as poetry and writings 3. record, reflect and document (structured and consistently) the emerging situationships continuing with the idea of working in individual and collaborative design spaces that help us set boundaries to our research interestest, I re-do my Design Space here: design space 03 / 2023 \u00b6 1PP design intervention in context \u00b6 29. january a first person perspective (1PP) approach means immersing oneself personally into a problem- and/ or design- space. this enables me to comprehend experientially the topic of interest. a 1PP intervention is one way to externalise ideas. my ideas (aka alternative presents ) are still broad but deal with imaginative thinking and its potentialities to transform the unknown into a space for creating dynamic, multi-perspective worldviews. through my collaborative 1PP interventions, I aim to put this idea into practice and experiment with its potential. after the first design dialogues some roads lead to 1PP interventions that I excecuted with my research-partner Myrto. one of them is especially interesting to mention here as it is closely linked to the theoretical concept we talked about. we visiting our mentor Oscar Tomico to observe his 1PP lifestyle. during this intervention we had the opportunity to observe what it means to live with plants from a 1PP. I realize (very clich\u00e9 though) that having a lot of expectations of what information I might gain, stand in the way of actually experiencing the information that\u2019s there. the decision not to use all the material we brought and only to record our conversation was a way of overcoming the anticipated map. I take from this the importance to have a clear question (goal?) that must come with the openness to work with what\u2019s at stake and be an attentive observer. a more detailed description of our visit at Oscar\u2019s place is described in this plantiversal lexicon . This experience shows (once again) how often expectations of what will happen, how things will develop, are not met. though, if I remain open to the unexpected, to the unknown ways of research, something fruitful and interesting can be the starting point for further developments ( isn\u2019t that food for new expectations? ). we brainstorm how it would be to make this home a space for others to live a 1PP perspective in a more accessible and inviting way. could thiss be a place for researches to sleep in? to work on their personal things? to drink, to eat, to live a while? design space 04 / 2023 \u00b6 as it becomes more clear that Myrto and me are a good team and plan our next design interventions together, we merge our individual Design Spaces into a collaborative one. Inhere we can now together (re)define our interests, weak signals and ongoing projects. network of co-responsibility - autoethnography \u00b6 05. february taking responsibility often means facilitating space for other voices to be able to resonate in. a 1PP design intervention can be a stage to other agents and communities (human and non-humans). we talked about facilitation during our community engagement class and it appears that this is not a simple task but on the contrary asks for timid planning and consideration. therefore it seems important to stand still and reflect on the agents that play a role in projects that are thought to be seslf-initialized. I talked about Autoethnography earlier on and it is closely linked to this as it describes the involvment of the me as a designer and importantly, the act of reflecting on my own personal experiences and perspectives. these reflections are then used as a basis to develop design strategies. autoethnography is the combination of personal reflections with an analysis of the social context. things that can guide my investigation and the analysis of my personal reflections: (1) define concrete boundaries to my object of interest, (2) reflect on the authenticity, my own truthfulness in my 1PP, (3) decide whether the experience is scholarly and can be written down or is just something plausible and thus less useful, (4) stay critical about whether I learn something, (5) practice self-revealing communication and don\u2019t filter out anything, (6) try to only use ethnographic material when useful, (7) consider the generalizability of the object of investigation. what is my network of co-responsibility? next to Myrto, from whom are my interventions dependent and who and what does have impact in the course of them? who and what are driving forces for my design practice? a conference not in our heads it seemed a sproutful idea to put together various thinkers and let them share their experiences on a conference we would organize. however, we were able to take part in such conference ourselves, organized by a research institute that deals with transformations in the educational system. we presented our work in the form of a paper on this small conference about speculative fiction and its important in the context of (future) education. here is a more detailed description of that intervention . it happened in the basement-rooms of the Disseny Hub Barcelona and there were about 100 participants in person and another 100 that streamed the conference via online platforms. the agents participating and influencing this interventions were the dark and window-less basement room, the classical way of presenting research-papers on a stage and having a knowledgable audience listeing and taking notes. what mainly makes us reconsider the power of this format is the particular language that we use in these formats. a conference with a very particular topic attracts people with that very particular interest. this can be very fruitful as it allows for collaboration and common background knowledges yet it bears the danger of not questioning certain paradigms and using a vocabulary that becomes more narrow the more it is used. we all talk the same language (in regard to thinkers, concepts and philosophies), yet to somehow who is not engaging with the authors and text we all do, it seems hard to follow or comprehend what we are talking about. the idea of a conference in which specialists come together thus seems opposing our initial goal to open and widen conversations and perspectives on the realities we live and share. even if we are aware of the multiplicity of kinds and formats conferences can take on, we are reconsidering our idea of organizing a conference ourselves after these three days with the Esbrina Research Group. these days remained a place in which works, practices, experiences are presented and exchanged rather than created in being-with. the human agents of that interventions on the other hand led to interesting connections and a network of people with which we will continue to work with. \u201csensclusion\u201d is a research project led by artist and anthropologist Quim Bonastre that deals with the socio-cultural connection of people to spaces in vulnerable neighbourhoods and how healthy ties can be fostered. these interventions that I will co-design here and are not in my hands alone, we share the responsibitlity with the places we will engage with, the people that we encounter, and the methods we use. design space 05 / 2023 \u00b6 I integrate all these new ties and ideas and (re)consideration of previous thoughts in a next Collaborative Design Space in which I share the responsibilities of its development. radical situatedness - the infrastructure \u00b6 26. february radical situatedness builts on the network on co-responsibility and emphazises even more on letting go of control over directing the design intervention. it is understood as making use of immediate environments and context and letting the research be influenced by what is there instead of trying to build up a surrounding that seems a priori fruitful to investigate. having talked, and though, and brainstormed, and mindmapped, and read, and written, and so much more the last month about facilitating spaces for speculating, we organize a workshopvin which more than us (Myrto and me), (and maybe even more-than-human actants) imagined non-realities. more detailed you can read about that intervention here . we went into it motivated and naiv (which I consider good - even when reflecting on how it went), without too many expectations but a good plan in our heads and hands. we created some ply-wood cards that could guide us and the participants through the day. I will summ up some of the reflections Myrto and me had on that day and the situation we found ourselves in: Participants \u2022 selected and invited by facilitators \u2022 group size was good for the collective process (10 + 2 facilitators) \u2022 there was litle diversity in terms off backgrounds \u2022 everyone was somehow interested and linked to he topic Tools: \u2022 instruction cards (prepared with the laser cutter in ply-wood) were pretty but not functional for the intended use because they were too small in size / we had not enough printed to provide each with their own \u2022 pens and papers were enough to support the verbal input \u2022 we could try more multimedia tools like paintings, recorders, iPads in the future Space: \u2022 convenient location, nice atmosphere, and hospitable environment Day and Time: \u2022 saturday morning worked well, people don't usually work and it wasn't too early or late (from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.) \u2022 duration was a little too long, especially the last part (3 hours) Topic/ transition in focus: \u2022 relevant, linked to all paricipants, futue-oriented (transition from in-person education to hybrids with online-exchange platforms) \u2022 the transiton already had happened partly and seems very much linked to realities we all experience in our everyday lifes: might have caused a lack of imagination \u2022 still overall a interesting trigger for speculative, fictional discussions about an unknown future Workshop Format: \u2022 the creational part was somewhat sidelined \u2022 great exchanged and sharing of visions (pretty realistic) but left it there \u2022 failed to collectively ideate more radical \u2022 failed to create completely new narratives (is that a problem?) we are confused what to do with all this information and are writing promts that we feed the Artificial intelligences ChatGPT, Midjourney and DALL-E with. we want to get inspired how we can transform all our abstract thought and wordplays into somoething habtic, some installation or structure that is threre-dimensional and touchable. what comes out are interesting new points of departure: images and stories about movable, educational pods we are intrigued what would happen if we would integrate the AIs in the workshop process itself during follow up interventions. design space 06 / 2023 \u00b6 our collaborative Design Space right after the workshop is confusing and multidirectional. we are a bit lost alternative presents \u00b6 12. march \u201cAlternative presents give designers the key to opening escape offering space to radically imagine and that would offer different outcomes in favor of more optimistic future scenarios than the ones we are being presented as the most plausible results of our current business-as-usual practices\u201d by oscar tomico talking about alternative presents means creating a present tense narration of something not existing but something that seems desireble when reflecting on the investigations and experiments our interventions have led us to. the MDEF\u2019s 1PP methodology aims to help to externalize ideas through design-interventions that follow the principles of autoethnography and radical situatedness . My idea ( aka alternative present ) is that through imaginative thinking we can transform the unknown into a space for creating dynamic, multi-perspective worldviews. Through my collaborative interventions, I aim to put this idea into practice and experiment with its potential. My vision ( autoethnographic boundaries ): I believe that amplifying (critical and speculative) stories can strengthen our sense of responsibility (ancestry) and possibilities (futurism) towards the pasts, presents, and futures, and that language and imagination can be used to make visible the interconnectedness of people across cultures and times. I also believe we can use language and imagination to express and explore the (human) experiences in the worlds, to provide a space for the marginalized and under-represented, and to make visible the interconnectedness (of people) across cultures and times. My mission: inspiring fictive thinking and free speculation about the transitions that we are going through to combat a homogenous and rigid habit of perceiving what\u2019s around us as static. My question ( radical situatedness ): what do I have at stake to materialize this open, inclusive, non-limiting place in which human and more-than-human narrate past(s), the present(s), and the future(s) in togetherness? Together with my so often mentioned friend Myrto, we are working towards diversifying narratives of the futures through collective intelligences that include more-than-human thoughts. Besides this exploration on how imaginative narratives can combat that one-sided storyline about the future, I found myself working with two other classmates Marielle and Carolina on decolonialisation. We came together in the FabLab track in which we got introduces to the hands-on part of the MDEF-facilities. Starting with a simple idea of raising awareness about the heroization that is still practiced in cities around the world, we developed a stamp that stamps a QR-code onto the object of colonialism. Scanning it will lead to a map on which the stamped location appears as a pin and the pins of other stamped places can be seen. This project is still in its beginning, yet I am excited about developing this into further directions. Here, we aim to provide a space for BIPOC-people to express their anger and as a side-effect maybe making all others realize the daily-life absurdities they are reproducing and living in. my alternative present \u00b6 I envision an alternative present in which imaginative practices inspire a holistic understanding of oneself in relation to others and the world by embracing the interconnectedness of different species and ecosystems. This combats the notion of isolated individuals that promote rigid and inflexible ideas about how the world should operate. Where realism reinforces a sense of human superiority and ignores the complex relationships that exist within and between lifeforms and other intelligences on Earth, Imagination offers the freedom to think the I (and civilizations) in symbiotic relationships with the earth and its ecosystems, recognizing progress and stagnation as nuances of one single process of change. It furthermore acknowledges the complexity and interdependences of the world(s) by expanding beyond the human realm to more-than-human philosophies by recognize the intelligence(s) and agencies of non-human entities like animals and AI. In this alternative present, the unknown represents certainty about a constant transformation of currently valid rules and conditions, which is interpreted as opportunity. design space 07 / 2023 \u00b6 linking all these thoughts and approaches, I individually mapped my current Design Space as followed. with this I try to answer following questions: where are the boundaries of my interventions? what sense do the imagined biograpies, the drifting processes make? how did my interventions evolute? how and where do I see them in the next interations?","title":"term II"},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/designstudio2/#_1","text":"","title":""},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/designstudio2/#design-studio-ii","text":"with Mariana and Jana the design studio is there to introduce us to the methodology the MDEF programm uses to imagine alternative presents . three phases are defining the structure of our year (actually only nine month). in term I we deal with framing perspectives, in term II we iterate through the practical embodying of scenarios, and in term III we scale ideas and projects up and build infrastructures that help realize them.","title":"design studio II"},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/designstudio2/#my-journey-so-far","text":"15. january After \u2153 of the MDEF journey, it seems like a good time to reflect on what has changed in my practice, what are new insights and what has remained from who I was when I started this course. where am I now and how did I change? Starting with the master program, my frustrations were in the ignorance politics of global (economic) infrastructure and the inequal distribution of its consequences. My sociology background made me question the power of power and what it is that makes (us) people so ignorant and disconnected. A topic, that my sociology-thesis dealt with, linking it to environmental attitudes. During my last years in the field of architectural design, my research became more practice oriented, and I realized that it needs a redefinition of global infrastructures towards enabling instead of controlling local dynamics of different societies. It appeared to me that the dependence on one narrative about the future is blinding and disempowering people through a depiction of the unknown as a dangerous insecurity. As in my previous studies also here I soon came to the point of being paralyzed when it comes to breaking things down, focusing on one concrete topic rather than extending my fingers into all directions. Yet this whole term was all about exploring and staying open (framing and exploring perspectives), so for the sake of the exercises I took (fresh) water as an example to visualize and prototype the localities of this resource. I was interested in (fresh) water and the uneven distribution of this vital resource across the globe. I co-created several design interventions, all related to my emerging design space in which certain weak signals appear repeatedly: Anthropocene conflicts, how technology can aid equality, and how collaboration can include more-than-human species. Conceptually I engage with thinkers that write about the importance of storytelling and more-than-human narrations of the realities we oversee. I gain more knowledge about (de)colonialist practices and the ancestral knowledges that (in my reality) are being continuously overwritten by capitalist and eurocentric philosophies. I become interested in multi-species collaboration and what it means to integrate non-human agents into design processes. This I explore through experimenting with listening practices that focus on non-human voices (water), with exploring what it means to be a non-human in the city that tries to access water (24h living-with challenge), with experimenting with water-probing to find out for whom (fresh)water is actually \u201cfresh\u201d and healthy, using artificial intelligence to define water cycles within the city, organizing a visit to the water facilitation center that treats Barcelona\u2019s fresh (and dirty) water ( Aig\u00fces de Barcelona in Llobregat del Prat), and facilitating an experience for others to step out of their human shoes (and into water). Next to my practical exploration, I read about the global politics of (fresh)water cycles, get angry about the practices of water grabbing and get fascinated about the many cultures that personify and value water as its own righteous entity. My design space at this point (design space 02 / 2022) deals with climate consciousness and how a global governance must set guidelines for healthy ecologies on one side yet must allow local contexts to feed out of their histories and built situated realities. As events unfolded, I realized that I am not interested in multispecies-design-practices per se. I see my agency more in creating spaces, in curating spaces where voices can resonate in. I am interested in disrupting the monophony of future(s) and in the potential of storytelling as a tool for speculation. This, all in the sense of human agency and voice. With my sociology education in the back of my head, I am constantly seeing the various (social) realities that are being created through stories and that empower (and disempower) people and more-than-human realities. I see a strength in fictional and collaborative processes that decentre the (human) self by consciously engaging with the bigger contexts we are embedded in. Throughout this journey, my path overlaps with my classmate Myrto\u2019s and we decide to work together. We develop an extensive research about binary-system thinking, post-nature, concepts of transitioning, and speculative fiction. We explored theories such as post-humanism (Timothy Morton, Slavoj Zizek),the mesh (Timothy Morton), anthropocene - capitalocene \u2013 cthulhucene epoch (Donna Haraway, Anna Tsing Lowenhaupt, Bruno Latour), carrier bag (Donna Haraway), the Gaia-theory (James Lovelock) to name a few.

My vision ( autoethnographic boundaries ): I believe that amplifying (critical and speculative) stories can strengthen our sense of responsibility (ancestry) and possibilities (futurism) towards the pasts, presents, and futures, and that language and imagination can be used to make visible the interconnectedness of people across cultures and times. I also believe we can use language and imagination to express and explore the (human) experiences in the worlds, to provide a space for the marginalized and under-represented, and to make visible the interconnectedness (of people) across cultures and times. My mission: inspiring fictive thinking and free speculation about the transitions that we are going through to combat a homogenous and rigid habit of perceiving what\u2019s around us as static. My question ( radical situatedness ): what do I have at stake to materialize this open, inclusive, non-limiting place in which human and more-than-human narrate past(s), the present(s), and the future(s) in togetherness? Together with my so often mentioned friend Myrto, we are working towards diversifying narratives of the futures through collective intelligences that include more-than-human thoughts. Besides this exploration on how imaginative narratives can combat that one-sided storyline about the future, I found myself working with two other classmates Marielle and Carolina on decolonialisation. We came together in the FabLab track in which we got introduces to the hands-on part of the MDEF-facilities. Starting with a simple idea of raising awareness about the heroization that is still practiced in cities around the world, we developed a stamp that stamps a QR-code onto the object of colonialism. Scanning it will lead to a map on which the stamped location appears as a pin and the pins of other stamped places can be seen. This project is still in its beginning, yet I am excited about developing this into further directions. Here, we aim to provide a space for BIPOC-people to express their anger and as a side-effect maybe making all others realize the daily-life absurdities they are reproducing and living in.","title":"alternative presents"},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/designstudio2/#my-alternative-present","text":"I envision an alternative present in which imaginative practices inspire a holistic understanding of oneself in relation to others and the world by embracing the interconnectedness of different species and ecosystems. This combats the notion of isolated individuals that promote rigid and inflexible ideas about how the world should operate. Where realism reinforces a sense of human superiority and ignores the complex relationships that exist within and between lifeforms and other intelligences on Earth, Imagination offers the freedom to think the I (and civilizations) in symbiotic relationships with the earth and its ecosystems, recognizing progress and stagnation as nuances of one single process of change. It furthermore acknowledges the complexity and interdependences of the world(s) by expanding beyond the human realm to more-than-human philosophies by recognize the intelligence(s) and agencies of non-human entities like animals and AI.

We are equipped with cameras and pens and big papers and all kinds of ideas how we will map out the more-than-human interrelationships that we will observe that evening. Three hours later, we leave the building again, not one picture is taken, not one line is drawn, we leave empty headed and with a heavy audio file on our phones. Somehow it feels more natural to sit on the couch among all the green life and exchange thoughts about cohabitation over tea and biscuits. That said, the spaces that could serve as areas for drawing, mapping, or moving around are very limited, as plant pots and vases are literally taking up the entire room. But we soon agree on a interview format for this meeting as it seems very overwhelming to start drawing the relations at hand when not knowing anything about their pasts and presents. So, we listen, ask, take notes, agree, and disagree. Oscar shows us every corner of the plant world and the moment I accidentally touch a hanging branch with bright green leaves, he immediately draws my attention to it. There is a lot at stake here. A table, chairs, light and air. Wifi. We talk about how his co-living can evolve into an alternative present in here. Rather than him as a designer using the space as his autoethnographic research-centre, we could make this place here, in which Oscar and these plants are living, this apartment on the third floor of a building in the city of Barcelona, accessible. Instead observing alone, more people could execute their research about the interrelations they will become part of. It is only sometime later, that Myrto and me sit in her living room and listen individually to the audio file, now having all the papers and pens in front of us, writing down quotes, point out agents and draw lines and arrows that connect and disconnect. After doing this on our own, we combine it in a digital space (our favourite tool: the Miro board). What do I take? During this intervention we had the opportunity to observe what it means to live with plants from a first person perspective. I realize (very clich\u00e9 though) that having a lot of expectations of what information I might gain, stand in the way of actually experiencing the information that\u2019s there. The decision not to use all the material we brought and only to record our conversation was a way of overcoming the anticipated map. I take from this the importance to have a clear question (goal?) that must come with the openness to work with what\u2019s at stake and be an attentive observer. (2) the traveller starts their journey \u00b6 end of january till end of february at Ombu as part of the design dialogues in december we made a sculpture that wears a lot of questions and QR-codes. The Traveller was a spontaneous creation that we hope to be a fruitful incentive to inspire conversations in a digital platform about post-humanism, binary system thinking, and more-than-human intelligences. We organized the many questions alongside the three-partition that we defined for processes of transitioning (unfamiliarize, grief, rebirth). Having all that in mind, we brought The Traveller with all our questions and the QR-code that leads to the Etherpad and Miro-board , to a neighbourhood caf\u00e9 in which it resonated for a few weeks with the daily public. The caf\u00e9 Omb\u00fa is in Poblenou right in front of the headquarter of the delivery service Glovo and in between many private universities that deal with architecture and design. We are aware that the cafes, the neighbourhoods as well as the posed questions will not much deviate from our snow-ball-effect bubbles. It is one way of prototyping our idea for now. What do I leave and what do I take? The digital platform has not triggered the exchange and traffic we wished for. Only a few contributions appeared on the Etherpad in the first weeks. The lack of inspiration can have various reasons, but we see the biggest obstacle in the unspecific nature of our questions and topics. Without a connection to one\u2019s own life and reality, it seems very difficult to engage in questions about abstract concepts that are often not fully understood. Even though our Etherpad has a small and clear lexicon of the terms we are dealing with, it seems to be too much effort to deal with them without direct feedback. An important takeaway, therefore, is to enable direct feedback and offer concrete links that people can identify with. Yet we met Nithin, who came across The Traveller while drinking his coffee and got intrigued because he is writing his master thesis on speculative-, transition-, and pluriversal design. He contacted us and we met a few times to talk about our common interest and design practices. The idea is to collaborate (bringing together our resources and ideas) on an event in the coming month. (3) imaginar mundus possibles in disseny hub \u00b6 on 19.01.2023. presenting our paper on the importance of storytelling As I already mentioned earlier, after the first design dialogues in December, Myrto and me applied with a simple idea to a complex conference on speculative futures organized by the Esbrina Research Group . its name: imaginar mundos posibles: Potencialidades, l\u00edmites y fricciones de la ficci\u00f3n especulativa en la investigaci\u00f3n y la educaci\u00f3n . And here we were then,19 th of January and we are going down the stair of the Disseny Hub Barcelona to reach the underground conference facilities. The paper we wrote emphasizes the importance of creating and listening to stories in a world where few voices and stories are being noticed. We argue that stories are essential for going beyond monophonic and catastrophic narratives, and that they are a form of \u201cattunement\u201d to the worlds we find ourselves in. We propose a method for diversifying narratives about the future by democratizing storytelling and using speculative fiction as a tool. Based on Timothy Morton\u2019s concept of a \u201cmesh\u201d, we propose a mapping technique that creates space for entangled narratives to evolve, encouraging participants to speculate about fictional scenarios that play out in this \u201cweb of life\u201d. The paper will soon be published (in an internal publication of the conference) and you have full access to it here (if you are interested). The conference took place over the course of two full days that were filled with presentations (in Castellano and Catalan) of other researchers that deal with speculative fiction as design methodologies. It was very interesting to listen to and we got in contact with curious minds and experienced practitioners. On Friday afternoon we had the chance to participate in a workshop under the lead of Yuri Tuma who is part of the artist collective The Institute for Postnatural Studies whose practice we both (Myrto and me) admire. This two-hour workshop left us enthusiastic and with many ideas and contacts on how and with whom we can continue our storytelling practice in more concrete ways. What do I leave and what do I take? Experiencing this conference was a direct sharing of the thoughts that others have around design practices that facilitate spaces for alternative worldviews. On the conference people presented their research fields and interests and we engaged in inspiring conversations and speculations. While it felt while being there as a fruitful exchange of likeminded people, reflecting on the conference latter on makes me realize what a exclusive group of people and minds this represents. We all talk the same language (in regard to thinkers, concepts and philosophies), yet to somehow who is not engaging with the authors and text we all do, it seems hard to follow or comprehend what we are talking about. The idea of a conference in which specialists come together thus seems opposing our initial goal to open and widen conversations and perspectives on the realities we live and share. Even if we are aware of the multiplicity of kinds and formats conferences can take on, we are reconsidering our idea of organizing a conference ourselves after these three days with the Esbrina Research Group. These days remained a place in which works, practices, experiences are presented and exchanged rather than created in being-with. What fascinated us a lot was the subtleness of Yuri Tuma\u2019s work and the strength of the speculative conversation his guidance evoked in the group of participants. There were about 30 of us between the ages of (more or less) 19 and 60, and everyone actively participated in the stimulating conversations and allowed the acting exercises to change perspectives and emphasise with unusual world views. Another branch that came out of the conference was my connection with Kevin Mar\u00edn, who approached us to be part of a research project he is involved in led by artist and anthropologist Quim Bonastre. Their research project \u201csensclusion\u201d deals with the socio-cultural connection of people to spaces in vulnerable neighbourhoods and how healthy ties can be fostered. This will become more important later, so I only mention here that these ties start to grow from here. (4) space for narrating the future of education \u00b6 on 25.03.2023. facilitating a space with myrto Having talked, and though, and brainstormed, and mindmapped, and read, and written, and so much more the last month, it has become time to try to facilitate that space for speculating in which more than us (Myrto and me), (and maybe even more-than-human actants) will benefit from imagining alternative realities. As we decided to (for now) put the idea of the conference on ice, we continue with the idea of a workshop. Based on what we read and experiences so far, we set up a curation of a first space in which we hope to inspire new perspectives and exchange. Along our three overarching concepts related to transitioning (unfamiliarized, grief, rebirth), we created some ply-wood cards with short descriptions of the concepts and their exercises that could guide us and the participants through the day. We went into it motivated and naiv (which I consider good - even when reflecting on how it went), without too many expectations but a good plan in our heads and hands. First workshop 25 th of February 2023, Barcelona, sun is shining, 10 degrees Celsius. It is a Saturday morning; we are meeting in the studio of our friend and mentor Jana in Raval. We have invited for 11 o clock, by 11:30 we are all together, had some tea and fruit and are coming together to stand in a circle. A short introduction round makes us realize the bubble we are in. Amanda from the States, a MDEF student who is interested in the creation of a makerspace and who loves the self-sufficiency of coding- and electronics. Maria from Italy, who is one of the inviters roommates and works in the social sector with people with disabilities. Nithin from India, who works at Glovo as a UX expert and who is writing his master thesis on speculative-, transition-, and pluriversal design. Korbi from Switzerland, who is a MDEF Master student and concerned with the exploitation of the labor force and the search for new ways to life without work. Georgio from Switzerland, who is his friend and curious to pass by. Daphne from Greece, who is an ex-MDEF student and after finishing a few years ago continued her journey in future design dealing with system and imaginations of speculating. Quim from Spain, who is a geography professor and artist in Lleida and has various practices that deal with the interaction of space and learning processes. Jana from spain, who is an ex-MDEF student and is interested in transhumanistic ways of thinking and designing. Claudia from Italy, who is a MEDF student and is interested in the change of social behavior towards a more conscious consumption of resources. And the two facilitators Myrto and Stella from Greece and Germany, who are MDEF students and interested in disrupting binary thinkings and exploring polyphonic narration. All in all, we are between 24 and 40 years old, white and somewhat linked to the topic of the invitation \u2013 the educational system and how it is changing. Before introducing the topic and goal of the day, we are asked to close our eyes and settle into our body and into the space we are in. A few guided breathings and we open our eyer again to meet each other in concentration and curiousness. The next few hours will be guided along three phases of transition \u2013 we will unfamiliarize, grief, and rebirth by the help of three exercises. We will be dealing with a transition that is happening and that we all have experienced somehow close or far \u2013 the switch from solely in-person learning and teaching to hybrid forms that come with the introduction of the internet and globally accessible platforms that enable online and live exchanges. We divide into three groups, taking in the perspectives of either teachers, students, or means of communication. Within the groups we discuss and dialogue about what the above mentioned transition would mean for our position, what would change practically and how would it affect our position emotionally? After about half an hour, we meet with the other groups in a standing circle and each group presents its burning issues. A discussion starts to evolve. It seems difficult to argue from the group\u2019s perspective and participants often appeal to their personal interests. For example, does Quim, who choose to represent means of communication, easily fall back into his actual role as a university professor and argues for the perspectives of the teacher. For the students, who all were students at one point in their lives (in this case not even very long ago and mostly still are), the participants refer to lived experiences. A discussion about the differences in legal regulation and the lack of digital skills arises. Soon all three groups agree on the current goals and deficits, which are not compatible with each other. We go into the next phase; After having unfamiliarized with what is known by taking in new perspectives and seeing what else there is at play, we continue into the grieving part. In the same groups we are asked to discuss what heritage we want to pass on, what essential qualities of the roles should not be forgotten but will eventually be something that is no longer practiced. For this phase the facilitators have calculated less time and after 20 min bring back the circle and we exchange the values we will be missing. This leads to a mapping of all the values that seem essential for learning and teaching, even in a digital future. Here, too, personal experiences, fears and desires are referred to and inspire our thoughts and words. Someone mentions the potentiality of hybridness and starts drawing a scenario in which these values can be kept while allowing digital spaces to take over (some of) the physical learning places. We are slowly transitioning into the third phase our day \u2013 the rebirth. Each on themselves now writes down three scenarios on three different papers without disclosing their headings: one desirable future that\u2019s possible, one undesirable future that\u2019s plausible, and one desirable future that\u2019s impossible. The studio with the low ceiling and the cold windows falls silent. We hear the pens on the paper, the teeth biting lips. When the facilitators announce five more minutes there is revolt, there is need for more time. Then we come together and place all our scripts face down on the floor in the middle of our standing circle. One by one we pick up a paper and read out loud what is written on it. Then we decide together if this is something we can imagine in a future education system that has made the transition from exclusively personal learning. There is a lot of movement now, we stand still, but there is laughter and discussion about all kinds of related implications. We discard the papers that are not wanted in our model and in this way build up a stack of propositions describing (parts of) an educational system that we would like to learn and teach with. A third stack of papers is the place for all the scripts we are not so enthusiastic about. The ones where we don\u2019t really know whether to give them a chance or discard them straight away. After three rounds, and many repetitions of readings, the floor in our midst is empty again. It is getting late, and as the participants have to leave at 2pm, we are led again into a closed-eye breathing, to ourselves and the space, before some words of gratitude end the session for the day. People leave slowly, some stay, eat some more fruit and share their experiences. another road that we take after some time passed by is to experiemtn with writing promts that we feed the Artificial intelligences ChatGPT, Midjourney and DALL-E with. we want to get inspired how we can transform all our abstract thought and word-plays into somoething habtic, some installation or structure that is threre-dimensional and touchable. what comes out are interesting new points of departure: images and stories about movable, educational pods What do I leave and what do I take? The selected participants and group size were good, but there was little diversity in terms of backgrounds. The workshop topic was relevant and future-oriented, but the transition had already happened partly, which may have limited imagination. Here, the instruction cards were pretty but not functional, and more multimedia tools could be tried in the future especially when trying to integrate and explore more-than-human intelligences. This also could help to inspire more radical ideas and imaginations about the topic of interest. At this moment, the workshop had a great exchange of realistic visions about the topic of interest, but it failed to ideate more radical ideas or create completely new narratives. Also, the timing of the workshop has been rethought as four hours was too long and tiring to deal with such abstract and creative processes. What we are very intrigued by was the experimentation with the AIs and its potenial for real-live integration of these tools into the workshop-process itself during follow up interventions. overall reflection \u00b6 Reflecting on the interventions I have co-facilitated from a 1PP perspective, my experiences show (once again) how often expectations of what will happen, how things will develop, are not met. Though, if I remain open to the unexpected, to the unknown ways of research, something fruitful and interesting can be the starting point for further developments (isn\u2019t that food for new expectations?). I think I understand better now what is meant by radical situatedness. It means being free of boundaries within the boundaries previously set. \u201cWhen the structure is broken, no context can fill it\u201d, and yet the content is always there, and it seems to be just a trick, just an exercise in knowing how to observe and see the content and of then placing, contextualising and (re)framing that content.","title":"second interventions"},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/interventions2/collectiveinterventions2/#collective-interventions","text":"","title":"collective interventions"},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/interventions2/collectiveinterventions2/#1-a-plantiversal-lexicon-for-a-designer-and-his-journey-towards-living-with","text":"on 09.01.2023. cartographying Oscar Tomico's trial on cohabitation It is a Monday night (the ninth of January, pretty freezing), after a day of classes and future talks, we (Myrto and me) are entering the building in which our teacher and mentor Oscar Tomico lives in an apartment on the second floor.

First workshop 25 th of February 2023, Barcelona, sun is shining, 10 degrees Celsius. It is a Saturday morning; we are meeting in the studio of our friend and mentor Jana in Raval. We have invited for 11 o clock, by 11:30 we are all together, had some tea and fruit and are coming together to stand in a circle. A short introduction round makes us realize the bubble we are in. Amanda from the States, a MDEF student who is interested in the creation of a makerspace and who loves the self-sufficiency of coding- and electronics. Maria from Italy, who is one of the inviters roommates and works in the social sector with people with disabilities. Nithin from India, who works at Glovo as a UX expert and who is writing his master thesis on speculative-, transition-, and pluriversal design. Korbi from Switzerland, who is a MDEF Master student and concerned with the exploitation of the labor force and the search for new ways to life without work. Georgio from Switzerland, who is his friend and curious to pass by. Daphne from Greece, who is an ex-MDEF student and after finishing a few years ago continued her journey in future design dealing with system and imaginations of speculating. Quim from Spain, who is a geography professor and artist in Lleida and has various practices that deal with the interaction of space and learning processes. Jana from spain, who is an ex-MDEF student and is interested in transhumanistic ways of thinking and designing. Claudia from Italy, who is a MEDF student and is interested in the change of social behavior towards a more conscious consumption of resources. And the two facilitators Myrto and Stella from Greece and Germany, who are MDEF students and interested in disrupting binary thinkings and exploring polyphonic narration. All in all, we are between 24 and 40 years old, white and somewhat linked to the topic of the invitation \u2013 the educational system and how it is changing. Before introducing the topic and goal of the day, we are asked to close our eyes and settle into our body and into the space we are in. A few guided breathings and we open our eyer again to meet each other in concentration and curiousness. The next few hours will be guided along three phases of transition \u2013 we will unfamiliarize, grief, and rebirth by the help of three exercises. We will be dealing with a transition that is happening and that we all have experienced somehow close or far \u2013 the switch from solely in-person learning and teaching to hybrid forms that come with the introduction of the internet and globally accessible platforms that enable online and live exchanges. We divide into three groups, taking in the perspectives of either teachers, students, or means of communication. Within the groups we discuss and dialogue about what the above mentioned transition would mean for our position, what would change practically and how would it affect our position emotionally? After about half an hour, we meet with the other groups in a standing circle and each group presents its burning issues. A discussion starts to evolve. It seems difficult to argue from the group\u2019s perspective and participants often appeal to their personal interests. For example, does Quim, who choose to represent means of communication, easily fall back into his actual role as a university professor and argues for the perspectives of the teacher. For the students, who all were students at one point in their lives (in this case not even very long ago and mostly still are), the participants refer to lived experiences. A discussion about the differences in legal regulation and the lack of digital skills arises. Soon all three groups agree on the current goals and deficits, which are not compatible with each other. We go into the next phase; After having unfamiliarized with what is known by taking in new perspectives and seeing what else there is at play, we continue into the grieving part. In the same groups we are asked to discuss what heritage we want to pass on, what essential qualities of the roles should not be forgotten but will eventually be something that is no longer practiced. For this phase the facilitators have calculated less time and after 20 min bring back the circle and we exchange the values we will be missing. This leads to a mapping of all the values that seem essential for learning and teaching, even in a digital future. Here, too, personal experiences, fears and desires are referred to and inspire our thoughts and words. Someone mentions the potentiality of hybridness and starts drawing a scenario in which these values can be kept while allowing digital spaces to take over (some of) the physical learning places. We are slowly transitioning into the third phase our day \u2013 the rebirth. Each on themselves now writes down three scenarios on three different papers without disclosing their headings: one desirable future that\u2019s possible, one undesirable future that\u2019s plausible, and one desirable future that\u2019s impossible. The studio with the low ceiling and the cold windows falls silent. We hear the pens on the paper, the teeth biting lips. When the facilitators announce five more minutes there is revolt, there is need for more time. Then we come together and place all our scripts face down on the floor in the middle of our standing circle. One by one we pick up a paper and read out loud what is written on it. Then we decide together if this is something we can imagine in a future education system that has made the transition from exclusively personal learning. There is a lot of movement now, we stand still, but there is laughter and discussion about all kinds of related implications. We discard the papers that are not wanted in our model and in this way build up a stack of propositions describing (parts of) an educational system that we would like to learn and teach with. A third stack of papers is the place for all the scripts we are not so enthusiastic about. The ones where we don\u2019t really know whether to give them a chance or discard them straight away. After three rounds, and many repetitions of readings, the floor in our midst is empty again. It is getting late, and as the participants have to leave at 2pm, we are led again into a closed-eye breathing, to ourselves and the space, before some words of gratitude end the session for the day. People leave slowly, some stay, eat some more fruit and share their experiences. another road that we take after some time passed by is to experiemtn with writing promts that we feed the Artificial intelligences ChatGPT, Midjourney and DALL-E with. we want to get inspired how we can transform all our abstract thought and word-plays into somoething habtic, some installation or structure that is threre-dimensional and touchable. what comes out are interesting new points of departure: images and stories about movable, educational pods What do I leave and what do I take? The selected participants and group size were good, but there was little diversity in terms of backgrounds. The workshop topic was relevant and future-oriented, but the transition had already happened partly, which may have limited imagination. Here, the instruction cards were pretty but not functional, and more multimedia tools could be tried in the future especially when trying to integrate and explore more-than-human intelligences. This also could help to inspire more radical ideas and imaginations about the topic of interest. At this moment, the workshop had a great exchange of realistic visions about the topic of interest, but it failed to ideate more radical ideas or create completely new narratives. Also, the timing of the workshop has been rethought as four hours was too long and tiring to deal with such abstract and creative processes. What we are very intrigued by was the experimentation with the AIs and its potenial for real-live integration of these tools into the workshop-process itself during follow up interventions.","title":"(4) space for narrating the future of education"},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/interventions2/collectiveinterventions2/#overall-reflection","text":"Reflecting on the interventions I have co-facilitated from a 1PP perspective, my experiences show (once again) how often expectations of what will happen, how things will develop, are not met.

We talked about bringing in personal questions (such as, How to be as designers?, What are our worldviews?), and aiming to generate more and more questions instead of searching for answers. Tomas mapped out this beautiful space for conversation. I was excited; this seemed all in line with my practice, aiming to create spaces for dialogues, stories, spaces for listening and perceiving other worldviews rather than reinforcing one\u2019s own. Yet in practice it all looked somehow different. During the last three classes (31.01, 17.01, 28.02) I practiced my patience and my listening. We met online, and via shared screens were exposed to presentations that left some room for questions at their very end. In a cold BCN apartment, with a hot water bottle at my feet, staring at a screen with 20 muted emojis of people who have their cameras off, it is far-fetched to talk about a conversation, and me, being normally very engaged and not word shy, I sit still, gathering my bouncing thoughts that do not find a physical space to resonate in. We spoke with (or better our guest spoke to a screen-recording) Benno Huarez from the rural coffee zone in Pero, he found the \u201cfloating fab lab\u201d in the amazon which aims to connect the nine countries the amazon river is flowing through starting in the small rainforest town Iquitos. He planted an image of \u201cdesign\u201d in our heads that reminds a tree: growing up in the air \u2013 thriving towards what feeds it (satisfaction from reaching our passions) yet at the same time being rooted deeply in the ground, depending on the resources available. Building on this metaphor, he makes us realize that it is not only what is available that is important, but above all what we make of it. The areas around the Amazon are home to an estimated 30% of the world\u2019s species, a large part of the Earth\u2019s biodiversity. And the resources that these species have at their disposal are all the same. In this sense, we are not limited by the resources we have, but by our idea of what we can do with the resources we have. We spoke with Felencia Hubarat from Indonesia who showed us into the beauty and diversity of the artistic and cultural fields in Indonesia. She engages in space-creation that support the local social infrastructures surrounding the arts and culture (AC) movement. As an example, she describes how she facilitates women gathering to cook together and exchange recipes, as well as everyday life stories. We spoke with Sudebi Thakurata from India who calls herself a meta facilitator and narrative designer. With her collective d-epicenter they practice to write-with, design-with, imagine-with the people at hand. They do this by \u201cconnecting the dots and looking at the larger picture while not overlooking the small, delving into a process if inquiry in an experimental, context-specific, transformational way that can blend economy with ecology, self with the society, past with the future, content with context and concept\u201d. Again, my eyes are shining throughout her talking and I can just see all the alignments in what my practices aims to facilitate \u2013 letting people tell (their) stories, disrupting the thinking in limits and dichotomies and placing ourselves within a wider universe of interconnections. The three seem to have found their practice of impact. The point of leverage from which meaning, and significance arises. Where does that leave me? And my practice? What do I take out of this that helps to define sense and meaning arising from my actions? Are there patterns within these talks or maybe in the way we were involved in these talks that deal with the question With what tools can we design the transition towards worlds in which systems of extraction are reconfigured? Discloser: I am writing the following essay partly with the help of ChatGPT that Tomas encouraged us to explore. ChatGPT is a tool that was launched in 2022 by the artificial intelligence research group OpenAI, that learns from the data with which it is fed. And till this point, who is feeding data into it, are white middle-aged man living and being socialized in North-American and Eurocentric-realities. It is not a intelligence generating tool but solely a text generating tool. As I will argue later more in detail, speculating about something in the future is linked to what is experiences in the past. ChatGPT does not experience in the way I do. Its memories are made solely from the information it gets and thus are its outputs. This bears the danger of not only amplifying and reinforcing but also reproducing the \u201cexperiences\u201d it has. Towards a world of speculative imagining \u00b6 I argue that one of the main tools we have at hand to transition towards another world-structure, is our (human) ability of imagining. Since we were able to memorize and speculate, to think in rational terms, imagination has been the basis for the realisation of transitions. However, this tool is often overshadowed by techno-utopian movements that seek to rebuild the future from scratch with new technologies and digital tools that promise to ease and fasten creative processes. The question I will address is whether an accelerated and easier process of creativity is satisfactory when it comes to giving sense and meaning to individual practices \u2013 and thus to caring communities? There are signs that creative practices are slowly diminishing due to capitalism\u2019s emphasis on productivity (=efficiency + profit maximization). A prioritization of short-term economic gains over long-term thinking is not only preventing young (and old) minds to imagine the unthinkable but also devaluating the importance of memorize experiences (individual as well as collective, inherited ones; human as well as the attentiveness towards more-than-human infrastructures such as we can observe in forests and ants colonies). Memory and imagination are interconnected because the process of imagining the new is always fed by what has been experienced (the old). The competitive nature of the market economy, where \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d is the law of order, makes time-intensive practices and experimentation without the known (such as imagining and dreaming) risks that are therefore rarely taken. There are also signs that the quest for sense and meaning is throwing more and more people into insecurities that lead to increasingly serious psychological problems. Linking sense and meaning to performance in terms of universal productivity and fulfilment keeps us in a constant state of comparison, where the global platforms constantly confront us with the goodness of unknown others; we are constantly bombarded with messages and images that suggest that other people are living more meaningful and fulfilling lives than we are. Our worth as human beings is based on how much we can produce or achieve which understandably leads to a sense of pressure to constantly perform and be successful, which then contributes to mental health problems. Listening to the three guest, Benno Huarez, Felecia Hubarat and Sudebi Thakurata, it appears that the globalized economy of making things easier sometimes makes us think it simplicity where there is complexity and makes things more complex when there is simplicity. All three experience the meaningfulness of what they do by having an impact on their immediate environment. We know that we cannot know how the world works because the complexity with which the earth is in constant transition is so complex that we are not able to think it (truly complex and not fixed, let alone comprehensible with universal rules, laws, solutions). But through imagination we can think up complexities that do not need to be understood. To imagine means to stop and memorise something and then to invent impossible worlds in our minds (actually simple: it\u2019s the stories we tell ourselves to go to sleep, the poems we write to express our feelings, the environments in which we picture our homes). In a conversational podcast about futurism and ancestrality, Joey Ayoub and Daniel Mcmillen Voskoboynik talk about the concept of rationality which is the basis of our social systems and involves evaluating information (data) and changing cultural habits according to that data. However, it is widely known that in many topics (e.g. coping with climate emergencies, dealing with social welfare and human rights\u2026) politics and societies act contrary to the data, and to explain this paradox, the concept of realism has been developed. Realism suggests that some behaviors cannot be adapted as the data of the real suggest because they are incompatible with how the structures of societies are interpreted and perceived by those with power. In this sense, the excuse of realistic obstacles when it comes to adapting behaviour, laws and rules to what is necessary is basically just an explanation for a man-made structure into which we want to fit the world. And it simply won\u2019t. So, our realistic world system is anything but rational or linked to whats observable data of the real . Speculative imagination can be a tool to overcome this paradox and all that goes with it as it does not even pretend to be linked to what\u2019s real. the speculative refers to something based on guesses or hypotheses rather than empirical evidence (data of the real). Therefore, speculative imagination is the capacity to think beyond what is currently known or possible, and rather to explore new ideas and possibilities. It refers to our ability to possibilitize a non-reality (would that mean to actually exploring realism?) by creating mental models of alternative worlds and scenarios. The paradox the two interlocutors see is that we are thus constantly busy with realistics things, that are not linked to the real we live with, which can be reason to why we often find ourselves searching for sense and meaning in a seeminly bottomless whole. And this again makes us feel unsatisfied and hopeless. What they furthermore discuss in line with this, is the importance yet unavailability of slowing down in a structures of acceleration. The climate emergencies asks for immediate change in pattern and habits (the earth overshoot day in 2022 was July 28. This year, in 2023 it will remain on that day . This means that by that time the critters on Earth have consumed what the earth can reproduce in the time of one year). Action must happen now against the physical extraction of (non-human) resources and the social exploitation of (human) resources. Yet at the same time, just followinf realistic approaches to real challenges is like being stuck in a hamster wheel. The way we do and the way we think must be decoupled from the sense of productivity that our systems put us into (the practice of imagining is not productive). As Benno Huarez mentioned, we are not limited by the resources we have, but by our idea of what we can do with them. Because thinking their usage anew and in real terms, asks for slower thinking processes that allow to release from realisms. We can find creative solutions even with limited resources if we take the time to imagine alternatives to the productive-oriented \u201csolutions\u201d. Yet this does not seem to be what is taught to the children that will be the makers of the future(s). That we live in a system of extraction is shown by the fact that our ability to memorize and imagine are declining. Imagining might not have the impact we desire when being stuck in the structures of productivity (that are resulting from such systems of extraction) as there is often no direct feedback to the practice of imagining. If we want to address the question of \u201chow we built the new in the shell of the old?\u201d (which pretty much sums up what futurism and ancestrality link), we need to raise the practice of imagining. And even then, the answers will remain varied and unspecific; they are not just there, and just as the search for sense and meaning will live on, so will our imagination, if we are able to memorise experiences. One way of dealing with the uncertainties of our times (be it the quest for sense and meaning or the inner fight of how to make up time to imagine alternative ways to use resources) seems to be trying to recognize one\u2019s immediate impact, the meaning one experiences through one\u2019s direct actions and imaginings, and yet accept that this never lives up to the complexity in which they are embedded. Like Benno at the river of the Amazon, like Felencia in the woman circles in Indonesia and Sudebi in processes of transformation. These creative thinkers suggest that creating impact involves speculating about resources, including communities that share their (collective) memories, and adopting holistic perspectives that do not ask for a universal categorization. This is not only freeing the mind to think things that do not need to produce a universal solution but at the same time is it a revolt against the fast-paced structures that drive us into forgetting and ignoring where we come from and where we are going. Let me end with the following wisdom on the importance of imagining, on the importance of utopias. In an interview, the writer Eduardo Galeano quotes the filmmaker Fernando Birro who was asked what utopias serve us: \u00bfPara que sirve la utop\u00eda? \u201cla utop\u00eda est\u00e1 en el horizonte, y cuando est\u00e1 en el horizonte, nunca lo voy alcanzar. Porque si camino diez pasos, la utopia se va lejar diez pasos. Y si camino veinte pasos, la utopia se va colocar veinte pasos mas all\u00e1. Osea, yo se, que nunca adem\u00e1s nunca la alcanzar\u00e9. \u00bfPara que sirve? Para eso. Para caminar.\u201d","title":"making sense and  meaning"},{"location":"term2/makingsense/makingsense/#_1","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 13-15 / 17 January - 7 February 2023","title":""},{"location":"term2/makingsense/makingsense/#making-sense-and-meaning","text":"with Tomas Diez Tomas introduced this course in the first session as a platform for debate, for dialogue and exchange.

They do this by \u201cconnecting the dots and looking at the larger picture while not overlooking the small, delving into a process if inquiry in an experimental, context-specific, transformational way that can blend economy with ecology, self with the society, past with the future, content with context and concept\u201d. Again, my eyes are shining throughout her talking and I can just see all the alignments in what my practices aims to facilitate \u2013 letting people tell (their) stories, disrupting the thinking in limits and dichotomies and placing ourselves within a wider universe of interconnections. The three seem to have found their practice of impact. The point of leverage from which meaning, and significance arises. Where does that leave me? And my practice? What do I take out of this that helps to define sense and meaning arising from my actions? Are there patterns within these talks or maybe in the way we were involved in these talks that deal with the question With what tools can we design the transition towards worlds in which systems of extraction are reconfigured? Discloser: I am writing the following essay partly with the help of ChatGPT that Tomas encouraged us to explore. ChatGPT is a tool that was launched in 2022 by the artificial intelligence research group OpenAI, that learns from the data with which it is fed. And till this point, who is feeding data into it, are white middle-aged man living and being socialized in North-American and Eurocentric-realities. It is not a intelligence generating tool but solely a text generating tool. As I will argue later more in detail, speculating about something in the future is linked to what is experiences in the past. ChatGPT does not experience in the way I do. Its memories are made solely from the information it gets and thus are its outputs. This bears the danger of not only amplifying and reinforcing but also reproducing the \u201cexperiences\u201d it has.","title":"making sense and meaning"},{"location":"term2/makingsense/makingsense/#towards-a-world-of-speculative-imagining","text":"I argue that one of the main tools we have at hand to transition towards another world-structure, is our (human) ability of imagining. Since we were able to memorize and speculate, to think in rational terms, imagination has been the basis for the realisation of transitions. However, this tool is often overshadowed by techno-utopian movements that seek to rebuild the future from scratch with new technologies and digital tools that promise to ease and fasten creative processes. The question I will address is whether an accelerated and easier process of creativity is satisfactory when it comes to giving sense and meaning to individual practices \u2013 and thus to caring communities? There are signs that creative practices are slowly diminishing due to capitalism\u2019s emphasis on productivity (=efficiency + profit maximization). A prioritization of short-term economic gains over long-term thinking is not only preventing young (and old) minds to imagine the unthinkable but also devaluating the importance of memorize experiences (individual as well as collective, inherited ones; human as well as the attentiveness towards more-than-human infrastructures such as we can observe in forests and ants colonies). Memory and imagination are interconnected because the process of imagining the new is always fed by what has been experienced (the old). The competitive nature of the market economy, where \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d is the law of order, makes time-intensive practices and experimentation without the known (such as imagining and dreaming) risks that are therefore rarely taken. There are also signs that the quest for sense and meaning is throwing more and more people into insecurities that lead to increasingly serious psychological problems. Linking sense and meaning to performance in terms of universal productivity and fulfilment keeps us in a constant state of comparison, where the global platforms constantly confront us with the goodness of unknown others; we are constantly bombarded with messages and images that suggest that other people are living more meaningful and fulfilling lives than we are. Our worth as human beings is based on how much we can produce or achieve which understandably leads to a sense of pressure to constantly perform and be successful, which then contributes to mental health problems. Listening to the three guest, Benno Huarez, Felecia Hubarat and Sudebi Thakurata, it appears that the globalized economy of making things easier sometimes makes us think it simplicity where there is complexity and makes things more complex when there is simplicity. All three experience the meaningfulness of what they do by having an impact on their immediate environment. We know that we cannot know how the world works because the complexity with which the earth is in constant transition is so complex that we are not able to think it (truly complex and not fixed, let alone comprehensible with universal rules, laws, solutions). But through imagination we can think up complexities that do not need to be understood. To imagine means to stop and memorise something and then to invent impossible worlds in our minds (actually simple: it\u2019s the stories we tell ourselves to go to sleep, the poems we write to express our feelings, the environments in which we picture our homes). In a conversational podcast about futurism and ancestrality, Joey Ayoub and Daniel Mcmillen Voskoboynik talk about the concept of rationality which is the basis of our social systems and involves evaluating information (data) and changing cultural habits according to that data. However, it is widely known that in many topics (e.g. coping with climate emergencies, dealing with social welfare and human rights\u2026) politics and societies act contrary to the data, and to explain this paradox, the concept of realism has been developed. Realism suggests that some behaviors cannot be adapted as the data of the real suggest because they are incompatible with how the structures of societies are interpreted and perceived by those with power. In this sense, the excuse of realistic obstacles when it comes to adapting behaviour, laws and rules to what is necessary is basically just an explanation for a man-made structure into which we want to fit the world. And it simply won\u2019t. So, our realistic world system is anything but rational or linked to whats observable data of the real . Speculative imagination can be a tool to overcome this paradox and all that goes with it as it does not even pretend to be linked to what\u2019s real. the speculative refers to something based on guesses or hypotheses rather than empirical evidence (data of the real). Therefore, speculative imagination is the capacity to think beyond what is currently known or possible, and rather to explore new ideas and possibilities. It refers to our ability to possibilitize a non-reality (would that mean to actually exploring realism?) by creating mental models of alternative worlds and scenarios. The paradox the two interlocutors see is that we are thus constantly busy with realistics things, that are not linked to the real we live with, which can be reason to why we often find ourselves searching for sense and meaning in a seeminly bottomless whole. And this again makes us feel unsatisfied and hopeless. What they furthermore discuss in line with this, is the importance yet unavailability of slowing down in a structures of acceleration. The climate emergencies asks for immediate change in pattern and habits (the earth overshoot day in 2022 was July 28. This year, in 2023 it will remain on that day . This means that by that time the critters on Earth have consumed what the earth can reproduce in the time of one year). Action must happen now against the physical extraction of (non-human) resources and the social exploitation of (human) resources. Yet at the same time, just followinf realistic approaches to real challenges is like being stuck in a hamster wheel. The way we do and the way we think must be decoupled from the sense of productivity that our systems put us into (the practice of imagining is not productive). As Benno Huarez mentioned, we are not limited by the resources we have, but by our idea of what we can do with them. Because thinking their usage anew and in real terms, asks for slower thinking processes that allow to release from realisms. We can find creative solutions even with limited resources if we take the time to imagine alternatives to the productive-oriented \u201csolutions\u201d. Yet this does not seem to be what is taught to the children that will be the makers of the future(s). That we live in a system of extraction is shown by the fact that our ability to memorize and imagine are declining. Imagining might not have the impact we desire when being stuck in the structures of productivity (that are resulting from such systems of extraction) as there is often no direct feedback to the practice of imagining. If we want to address the question of \u201chow we built the new in the shell of the old?\u201d (which pretty much sums up what futurism and ancestrality link), we need to raise the practice of imagining. And even then, the answers will remain varied and unspecific; they are not just there, and just as the search for sense and meaning will live on, so will our imagination, if we are able to memorise experiences. One way of dealing with the uncertainties of our times (be it the quest for sense and meaning or the inner fight of how to make up time to imagine alternative ways to use resources) seems to be trying to recognize one\u2019s immediate impact, the meaning one experiences through one\u2019s direct actions and imaginings, and yet accept that this never lives up to the complexity in which they are embedded. Like Benno at the river of the Amazon, like Felencia in the woman circles in Indonesia and Sudebi in processes of transformation. These creative thinkers suggest that creating impact involves speculating about resources, including communities that share their (collective) memories, and adopting holistic perspectives that do not ask for a universal categorization. This is not only freeing the mind to think things that do not need to produce a universal solution but at the same time is it a revolt against the fast-paced structures that drive us into forgetting and ignoring where we come from and where we are going. Let me end with the following wisdom on the importance of imagining, on the importance of utopias. In an interview, the writer Eduardo Galeano quotes the filmmaker Fernando Birro who was asked what utopias serve us: \u00bfPara que sirve la utop\u00eda? \u201cla utop\u00eda est\u00e1 en el horizonte, y cuando est\u00e1 en el horizonte, nunca lo voy alcanzar. Porque si camino diez pasos, la utopia se va lejar diez pasos. Y si camino veinte pasos, la utopia se va colocar veinte pasos mas all\u00e1. Osea, yo se, que nunca adem\u00e1s nunca la alcanzar\u00e9. \u00bfPara que sirve? Para eso. Para caminar.\u201d","title":"Towards a world of speculative imagining"},{"location":"term2/measuringworld/measuringworld/","text":"\u00b6 \ud83d\uddd3 Week 19 / 8. - 11.

Marielle and Carolina had already found each other and merged their POC-experience-frustrations into a concrete idea of working with the ignorance of white people towards the statues of colonizers and their histories in the city (BCN). in my theoretical thoughworld I am dealing a lot with (de)colonial practices and anyways, this means re-telling stories and giving voice, so I stepped in to become the white addative to our multiracial team. Museum Of Colonialization (MOC) \u00b6 with marielle and carolina there are multiple spaces where I reflect on this weeks work, we worked in a miro board , maintained a notion page throughout the processs, and created a GitHub repository for an easy access to our files and experiences. here I will more individually reflect on the team work and my individual input. how we came together \u00b6 our overlapping interest show our common concern with the \u201ctruth\u201d we are being told and the way to tackle their revealments. we agree on that the present time was very poorly designed by a selective group and that it needs the uncovering of the dirty history of hidden public artifacts in order to embrace other futures (by other we mean the furthest point possible from patriarchy, capitalist and neo-colonist structures). in our ideation processes and references we encounter funny ways to deal with ignorance and cynical approaches to sillyness. what we provide \u00b6 we design a first prototype for a transparent gumball machine that contains easily digestible, fun(?) facts about the colonisers who have shaped the city. the idea is that one encounters it somewhere in the city, presses a button and opens the (paper) ball received. inside, one finds a sticker with the image of a coloniser and a fun(?) fact about that person. opening the paper ball reveals a letter asking the reader to follow the given coordinates and place the stickers at the location - which will be associated with the (legacy of the) person on the sticker. We aim to raise awareness and engage white citizens (whiteness here as a concept of power and privilege of the dominant group in society) who do not think about the people who were and are celebrated as homeland heroes, let alone know about their terrible deeds, and are often not interested enough to research the history themselves. that is why the machiene is supposed to operate in the multiverses of Barcelona and spit out the balls to those who actively make a promise to obtain knowledge. We call this gumball machine, the museum of colonialization (MOC). how we get there - in theory \u00b6 the first phases are thinking processes about how we want people to engage with the colonial past of the city. we come up with ideas of a toolkit to cast immediate environments and transform them into stamps, we think about pasting QR-codes onto statues that would lead to a digital environment of knowledge transmission. soon we venture to the idea of having a gumball machine that in exchange for a promise spits out little versions of the statues that are to be found in the city with their coordinates and some unpopular funny (or rather cynic?) facts about their background. we early on in the process agree upon making knowledge easily digestiable, not speaking to an intellectual public that(probably anyways) is concerned with the theme of (de)colonial practices but instead speak to all those people walking the streets without paying attention to the (come on, actually pretty obvious) colonial legacies. ok, so far so good, now it is just a matter of making a machiene that has a mechanism that spits out something (a ball) when pressing a buttom (to involve some arduino and coding here), little scultures that can be (dis)assembled (maybe press-fit with the lasercut), stickers on which there are coordinates and fun(?) facts about the represented persons (vinylcut), balls that can contain these sculptures (origami-shapes cut with laser or vinyl), and of course the research on the people we would like to display (our intellect of using the world wide web). We devide tasks. even if one of our main overlaps is anti-economic-growth, the division-of-labor-thought serves well in the right moments (also we unfortunately put ourselves into a system that operates based on progress and output). together, Marielle and Carolina would design the look of the gumball machine. then, Marielle would take over the mechanic parts and with their arduino skills. With the help of Carolina whereever she would be helpful and has time to do so. furthermore, Carolina would be busy with designing the contents about the colonizers - whereas the research we would do the three of us. due to expected time-limitation we already here decide to pick each one person that is represented somehow in the city of Barcelona and each focus on some facts about that person. I would be concerned with the design of the ball for now and then help where needed. We have another idea att that moment. Maybe, a promise is not enough? What if we could create an application that opens the camera app automatically, and registered whether a photo of the stickered statue is hashtagges somewhere on social media? Well, wee see, that might be something for another iteration. For now, lets start crafting\u2026 how we get there - in practice \u00b6 I will rather shortly reflect on this here and only focus on the work I did individually. all of this and more can be found in the GitHub repository in more detail. somehow I was fascinated even from before with the online tool for origami simulations . so we decided I would make the shell, the ball to contain the colonizers out of folded paper. the making of the origami spheres was more complex than I expected but I had a lot of fun and curious outcomes while working on it. the steps I took: - getting to know origamisimulator.org (origami model visualization - researching origami-simulator library for a fitting design - adapting the design according to our needs - translating the (rhino)file into a file readable by the lasercutter (lasercutter software) - laser-cutting the piece in paper (includes the trial of power and speed of laser) - folding the paper into balls - adapt size and form of the sphere in rhino - translating the rhino file into a file readable by the vinylprinter (silhuette studio software) - vinyl-printing the piece onto paper (includes the trial of blade-depth and force of vinyl-knife) - folding the paper into balls the origami-simulator is designed by an amanda who very helping explains how things work and offer some example files on her github page . yet to understand all of this, it took some time and to figure that files can be created and adapted in rhino to work in the simulator, took some more. to explain it short here, she has some example files under which one of an amazing sphere and the simulation shows clearly how it folds and unfolds. I downloaded this file, opened it in rhino, exploded the existing design and define groups and color codes anew, accoding to the needs of our balls. the online simulator reads SVGs in one way (File - Design Tips on the webpage ) (Mountain folds have red stroke - rgb(255, 0, 0), hex #ff0000; Valley folds have blue stroke - rgb(0, 0, 255), hex #0000ff; Boundary edges have black stroke - rgb(0, 0, 0), hex #000000) which can vary from the rules used in the lasercutter- and the vinylprinter software. here often you can define the actions and allocate them to colors of choice. but its important to keep in mind that the simulation SVGs do not necessarily have the same color-codes as the rhino-files used for printing. After exporting the rhino-drawing as an SVG, the simulator shows my first trials that where kind of beautiful yet definetely not as expected. here you can see the simulation okay, once I figured how it all works, I tried to immitade amandas design and to play with some drawings in rhino, to then upload these into the simulator and print with the vinylcutter. here you can see the simulation of the almost final piece - something is still wrong . so in the end it all seemed quit difficult to get the right proportions and stuff so I sticked to amandas file and just adapted the size to a A3 length in order to make it handy when printing. and look there, the fold paper looks pretty much like the simulation. in the end, what does it matter if I create the file myself or downloaded other peoples work? sharing is caring and I am sure amanda put them out there for us to make use of them. a few more things that came up while cutting and printing\u2026 we use paper (because we want to print text on them and have the hapticity of a entrance ticket or letter or something foldable that is easy to pocket away), meaning tha engraving the pattern in order to make fold easier have to be very precise not to cut through fully. my experience with the lasercut. I tried a variety of power and speeds and in the end came up with this settings (yet they vary for each lasercutter.

We devide tasks. even if one of our main overlaps is anti-economic-growth, the division-of-labor-thought serves well in the right moments (also we unfortunately put ourselves into a system that operates based on progress and output). together, Marielle and Carolina would design the look of the gumball machine. then, Marielle would take over the mechanic parts and with their arduino skills. With the help of Carolina whereever she would be helpful and has time to do so. furthermore, Carolina would be busy with designing the contents about the colonizers - whereas the research we would do the three of us. due to expected time-limitation we already here decide to pick each one person that is represented somehow in the city of Barcelona and each focus on some facts about that person. I would be concerned with the design of the ball for now and then help where needed. We have another idea att that moment. Maybe, a promise is not enough? What if we could create an application that opens the camera app automatically, and registered whether a photo of the stickered statue is hashtagges somewhere on social media?

I downloaded this file, opened it in rhino, exploded the existing design and define groups and color codes anew, accoding to the needs of our balls. the online simulator reads SVGs in one way (File - Design Tips on the webpage ) (Mountain folds have red stroke - rgb(255, 0, 0), hex #ff0000; Valley folds have blue stroke - rgb(0, 0, 255), hex #0000ff; Boundary edges have black stroke - rgb(0, 0, 0), hex #000000) which can vary from the rules used in the lasercutter- and the vinylprinter software. here often you can define the actions and allocate them to colors of choice. but its important to keep in mind that the simulation SVGs do not necessarily have the same color-codes as the rhino-files used for printing. After exporting the rhino-drawing as an SVG, the simulator shows my first trials that where kind of beautiful yet definetely not as expected. here you can see the simulation okay, once I figured how it all works, I tried to immitade amandas design and to play with some drawings in rhino, to then upload these into the simulator and print with the vinylcutter. here you can see the simulation of the almost final piece - something is still wrong . so in the end it all seemed quit difficult to get the right proportions and stuff so I sticked to amandas file and just adapted the size to a A3 length in order to make it handy when printing. and look there, the fold paper looks pretty much like the simulation. in the end, what does it matter if I create the file myself or downloaded other peoples work? sharing is caring and I am sure amanda put them out there for us to make use of them. a few more things that came up while cutting and printing\u2026 we use paper (because we want to print text on them and have the hapticity of a entrance ticket or letter or something foldable that is easy to pocket away), meaning tha engraving the pattern in order to make fold easier have to be very precise not to cut through fully. my experience with the lasercut. I tried a variety of power and speeds and in the end came up with this settings (yet they vary for each lasercutter. I tried with another lasercutter and it was way to heavy there) but for the actual balls we did not make use of the lasercutter (mostly due to bad organization and availabilty of the lasercutter) but instead used the vinylcutter. this takes way longer and about the precision can be fought. but it had two great advantages\u2026 we could take it with us and for that work on it with immediate adaptations and because it has a blade instead of a laser, there are no traces of burning material to be seen in the end piece. for the vinyl print the final settings were the lowest possible for the folds and the standard cutting ones for the outline. okay, the making of the balls was thought to be the most easy and time-least intense task yet it turns out to keep us busy for quite some hours, days and evenings. in the end, we made it to these little creatures that thanks to Myrto got the name Armadillos (because they look like them\u2026). and heeeere in it\u2019s preliminary final state:","title":"how we get there - in practice"},{"location":"term2/microchallenges/microchallenge/#what-we-overlooked","text":"rather than reflecting on my personal shortcomings and the ways I could have had invested more into this (which sadly was pretty much constrained by my health conditions this week), I will take some time to write a citique on our common output and the alignment with out initial intentions.","title":"what we overlooked"},{"location":"term2/microchallenges/microchallenge/#critique-on-the-muesum-of-decolonization","text":"in February 2023, three master\u2019s students in Barcelona design a first prototype for a transparent gumball machine that contains easily digestible, fun(?) facts about the colonisers who have shaped the city. the idea is that one encounters it somewhere in the city, presses a button and opens the (paper) ball received. inside, one finds a sticker with the image of a coloniser and a fun(?) fact about that person. opening the paper ball reveals a letter asking the reader to follow the given coordinates and place the stickers at the location - which will be associated with the (legacy of the) person on the sticker. the teams aim is to raise awareness and engage white citizens (whiteness here as a concept of power and privilege of the dominant group in society) who do not think about the people who were and are celebrated as homeland heroes, let alone know about their terrible deeds, and are often not interested enough to research the history themselves. that is why the machiene is supposed to operate in the multiverses of Barcelona and spit out the balls to those who actively make a promise to obtain knowledge. they call the maschiene, the museum of colonialization (MOC). in designing the prototype, the team fuses architectural components from different places (relevant to them), mainly from china town(s) and indigenous and traditional Angolan houses.

There are still a lot of things we did not materialiize let alone put into practice and context yet. So whilw we rarely had time to work on it in the time in-between the micor-challenges, we all were motivated to dedicate that time again to contribute to decolonial practices. MOC-II (Museum Of Colonialization) \u00b6 with marielle and carolina In our part of the miro we are trying to capture our thoughts. Paralelly, we are working in a repo where you can find detailed information about the how\u2019s and what\u2019s, and in a notion page that has a more user-friendly documentation purpose. to follow our guirilla-traces, enter our map (it is updating only every hour - so have some patience if you are the one stamping atm) what we ask this time \u00b6 REDEFINITION: everywhere on the world we encounter signs of colonial-pracices that increase iniequalities. This can be linked to past practices of european colonialism, or present practices of plastic pollution. We can see this in the statues that populate city-streets but also in the plant-hybrids(ecological imperialism). The thing is, we constantly overlook these signs and keep things for granted in everyday life. Our goal is to make colonial-signs more visible to all of us passing them everyday. How can we provoke attention? How can we question what we take for granted? ideas to go on with from the first iteration of the MOC: \u2022 printing entry-tickets or receipts that a visitor gets once \u201cvisiting\u201d the museum. printing device \u2022 sticker to sticker the streetscapes (and statues) of the city - guerilla like We furthermore collected the qualities and the attributes we want our next iteration to have. Qualities: playful learning; feeling seen; questioning the everyday / taken for granted attributes: portable; interactive; respectful; fun; triggering what we provide \u00b6 a portable guerilla stamp that everyone can use to mark that they paid attention. That they recognize an entangled (hi)story that is not been paid enough attention to. this time we come up with the idea of a (guerilla) stamp / attention-button a la that was easy . A person pushes our button that at the same time is a stamp. Thus pressing onto the button leaves a print on the surface the button is put upon. And that surface can be anything from a statue, a strees, a building to a plant, a tree or a banana in the supermarket. Through the push-mechanism, a speaker is activated that says something (provoking) and the GPS location of the user is added to a MOC Map . The image the stamp stamps is a QR-code (and potentially a provocing sentence) that leads directlly to the map on which the user will encounter their location as a pin as well as all ther pins of prior users. how we get there - in theory \u00b6 we are designing a portable device that functions as a button and carries all the electronics that we need to excecute our codes. The device needs to be able to play a sound-file, determine its location and linking it to an online platform. At the same time, it needs to be able to be pressed against a surface and leave a trace with the image we want (stamp). For that we need to develop: software: code for speaker, code for GPS (more detailed later on) hardware: button-mechanism (take the big button that exists (arcade style) and just print a \u201clid\u201d, nice cover), stamp (eva foam block), ink, battery to charge, GPS, speaker, sd-card holder / MP3 shield, feather we devided task and it was interesting to see how a group work, in which each part is essential to the functioning of the whole turns out to be a very individual working time. Everyday we have lunch together on the roof and we update each other on our progress because in the end, each of us works alone. Marielle is busy with the stamp, button-machanism, I am doing the programming for the online mapping (GPS ect.) and Carolina is busy with programming the audio. how we get there - in practice \u00b6 all of the technical parts are more detailed documented in this GitHub repository . Here I will reflect on my personal workflow that was reelated to the GPS programming and the online linkages. we translate a cardboard prototype into Rhino to be 3D printed. We do this all together, giving feedback on assembling, practicality, function and measurements and combining small dots of knowledges we have between the three of us. We export it as an st-file and set up the CURA-file to print it in the 3D-printers over night. It takes two printing trials and the new designs I start over with grasshopper to be able to adapt the digital model according to the changing measurements of all the electronics that need to fit it. In another night way later on, we print another version which turns out good - as we want it for now. so then to the GPS first things first, is it possible? I talk with Victor: what we need is to record the geolocation and the time (through a GPS in the device). There needs to be featherboard in the device. On the featherbaord, we connect a GPS that will give us the data of the geolocation and time. Then, we have to link that data to a webpage or a existing map in order t create a QR code that can be translated into a stamp and will lead to that digital interfacec. This means, we meed to access a public webserver. The question is, through which server / which computer will we be able t translate the data from the feather onto the digital platform (map\u2026)? could be a this is mqtt (which works via publish and subscribe) technique. ok, it seems possible. With the help of Edu, I compile the hardware needed to obtain a GPS signal. I use our adafruiit featherboard and a Qwiic GPS SparkFun . We install some libraries linked to this specific GPS into our arduino app and run a few different example codes to see what we get. After few trials, it works (we have to leave the building though to get our location). So we have a GPS that gives us the date, time, longitute and altitude data. This now has to be translatetd from the feather and arduino, to a digital platform. It also has to work on battery if we want it to be portable. The part that was supposed to be the most easy part (translating the GPS data into a digital platform and into a simple data-sheet) turned out to take us a whole morning of searching in old codes, reading and watching tutorials and mixing it up to create our own code. Without Daphne and all her patience this would have never worked out. And then the end of course Victor who came for half an hour and brough some order into our chaos - and siehe da , the code works. One of our main manuals was this . the code at this stage: #include <SparkFun_I2C_GPS_Arduino_Library.h> //Use Library Manager or download here: https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_I2C_GPS_Arduino_Library I2CGPS myI2CGPS; //Hook object to the library #include <TinyGPS++.h> //From: https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus TinyGPSPlus gps; //Declare gps object #include <Wire.h> #include <WiFi.h> #include \"Adafruit_MQTT.h\" #include \"Adafruit_MQTT_Client.h\" #define WLAN_SSID \"wifi\" #define WLAN_PASS \"wifi password\" #define AIO_SERVER \"io.adafruit.com\" #define AIO_SERVERPORT 1883 #define AIO_USERNAME \"IO username\" #define AIO_KEY \"IO key\" WiFiClient client; const char MQTT_SERVER[] PROGMEM = AIO_SERVER; const char MQTT_USERNAME[] PROGMEM = AIO_USERNAME; const char MQTT_PASSWORD[] PROGMEM = AIO_KEY; // Setup the MQTT client class by passing in the WiFi client and MQTT server and login details.

(explanation of unknown names and words are following): \u2022 it sets up a wifi (because we wont have a sim-card in our stamp but in order to load the data directly into the digital world, a wireless connection is needed) - thus there is the possibility of chosinng a mobile-hotspot or to add the credentials of a local wifi. \u2022 it links the feather (GPS) to the adafruit IO server AND a personal account (that is needed to later on work with the date in multiple ways). So for this we made our adarfuit IO account and connect our feather ESP32. To test if there is a stable connection, we make the built in LED blink before we continue with our arduino code. \u2022 it sets up an MQTT that in our case equals our adafruit account. The MQTT in a network protocol, a language to enable the exchange of messages from remote locations and the digital (very important for the Internet of Things ). \u2022 furthermore we set up a button function to make sure that the GPS data is not being uploaded onto our digital platform constantly but only when we push. = bool butState part in the code. We make sure that the publishing function is being activated when the button is pushed and released. I have done some research on platforms that enable us to map our feather data in on online-and-real-time-updating map (to be an issue!). We try out various road. The adafruit IO WipperSnapper offers a mapping fuction, yet it turns out that they use another GPS-sensor and when trying to work with their file, it does nto run because our GPS is not a FONA GPS . To rewrite their code with our Qwiic GPS SparkFun seems a bit overwhelming, after a few trials, we leave it to that and search for something else. we still use the adafruit IO account with two feeds (one for longitude and one for latitude) and one dashboard (in which both are combined) . This is to get the data from the feather into the digital. Now we can see digitally appearing in the adafruit IO feeds the longitude, latitude, date and time when we push the buttom that is linked to the feather. In the end, we use the Adafruit IO only as a first translation to the online world and thus we only need one feed (no dasshboard or different feeds). For that, we rewrite our code just a tiny bit and sent latiude,longitude -data as one line to our longitude feed . And this feed can be linked to a google-sheet in which the data will appear clear and organized. The platform IFTTT offers multiple ways to link data to online services. One of them is the linkage of adafruit account to a googlsheet. And in google again, their googlemaps has a mymaps function. In this, we can create a \u201cprivate\u201d map that be can publish but with which we can subscribe to a google spreadsheet that we make (from our drive). Problem: the map is not updated automatically, neither is the spreadsheet (yet) meaning we have to update the map manually in order to update the pins on the map. So what we need is a way, code, trick to automate the data-translation from GPS to google spreadsheet AND a real-life update from google spreadsheet to the map created in mymaps. A little research further we stumple upon a googlesheet add-on from theXS mapping whose service offers us to mapp the data of our googlesheet in real-time in their maps - whose are linked to google maps (yet it somehow isnt mymaps anymore - however - XSmaps is fine by me). This seems to automate the process from spread-sheet to map - first moment of succcess = we see the coordinates on the map as little pins. Little downer, this automated process updates only hourly (if you dont pay for a pro-account) - not in real real time. But ok, es lo que hay. Somewhere we need to make compromises it seems. In IFTTT we edit out applet (which is just the name IFTTT gave to the linking-process). We edit and say if: there is new data in the adadfruit longitude feed, then add a new row into the latitude googlesheet in our drive (folder - location). Dont get confused with the names - its all a but messed up we know. summed up: we have a button that, when pushed, sends a GPS location to an adafruit IO account with the feed longitude . Via IFTTT, we send the data into a googlesheet which uses the XSmapping add-on to drop pins at the GPS data (updating it every hour). Furhermore, a audio-file is being played and a QR-code is being stamped. combining speaker, GPS and button the final code combines a push-button with a GPS and a Speaker that played audio from a SD-card: #include <SparkFun_I2C_GPS_Arduino_Library.h> //Use Library Manager or download here: https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_I2C_GPS_Arduino_Library I2CGPS myI2CGPS; //Hook object to the library #include <TinyGPS++.h> //From: https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus TinyGPSPlus gps; //Declare gps object #include <Wire.h> #include <WiFi.h> #include \"Adafruit_MQTT.h\" #include \"Adafruit_MQTT_Client.h\" #include \"Arduino.h\" #include \"DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h\" #define WLAN_SSID \"Iaac-Wifi\" #define WLAN_PASS \"EnterIaac22@\" #define AIO_SERVER \"io.adafruit.com\" #define AIO_SERVERPORT 1883 #define AIO_USERNAME \"IO username\" #define AIO_KEY \"IO key\" #define RXD2 16 #define TXD2 17 WiFiClient client; HardwareSerial mySoftwareSerial(2); DFRobotDFPlayerMini myDFPlayer; void printDetail(uint8_t type, int value); const char MQTT_SERVER[] PROGMEM = AIO_SERVER; const char MQTT_USERNAME[] PROGMEM = AIO_USERNAME; const char MQTT_PASSWORD[] PROGMEM = AIO_KEY; // Setup the MQTT client class by passing in the WiFi client and MQTT server and login details.

That again requires a battery. And well, as we are working with wifi (wether that is a local source or a hotspot connection), the battery will pretty soon be dead because it will constantly search for signals around. To solvve that problem, josep helps me to programm the device so that only when pushing the button, the battery will turn on, it will search for wifi, connect with MQTT and with that send data to the Adafruit IO before after waiting for a few seconds it will fall to sleep again. In arduino itself, there is an example code called ExternalWakeUp. This is how you find it: our favorite tutorial for this ! well, so we try this out a few times untill it works and then combine it with our code for the GPS and audio. It does not work anymore. Bueno, we recognize, that it might take some time for the wifi to connect and the MQTT to establish a connection to we programm some delays so our MOC will not go to sleep again too soon. Now it works. problem when assembling our handy device, it appears that in the end all our electroics are too much for the 3D printed model of our portable stamp. With battery and speaker and feather and GPS and all the cables it get pretty crowded and stuffed in there. As soon as we close it off, the conenction fails - probably one of the thousand little colourful cables got lost their pins and schwups , everything is broken. After a few trials we decide to take out the microphone. We anyway have an issue with its sound-file, somehow it does not perfectly play the whole piecce and our \u201cthat\u2019s soooo colonial\u201d sentence gets a bit lost. So, we (for now) decide to focus on the essentials, the stamp, the QR-code and the GPS-signal for the map. therefore, our code shrinks a bit and looks like this: /* Deep Sleep with External Wake Up ===================================== This code displays how to use deep sleep with an external trigger as a wake up source and how to store data in RTC memory to use it over reboots This code is under Public Domain License.

What all the platforms we encountered in the last few days are doing, is putting their brandmark onto simple and open-to-the-public funcions. Companies like googe, adafruit, IFTT are hiding these functions behind new names (e.g. renaming topic int feed or dashboard). if in the future we want to bypass making 4 different accounts on various websited and crearing complex detours that are slowing down the processing of our data from one place to another, we can do some deeper research towards protocolls. how to post mqtt data digitally and accessibly? (in a sheet, a map, a webpage\u2026) is the actual questiona and there seems to be no need for companies such as google to translate anything Instead of using Adafruit IO ( account 1 ) that started of as a platform to make information of these simple protocolls available to citizens, yet was tragged into patters that serve to hide the simplicity and accessiibility of code-fuctions, or IFTT ( account 2 ) to translate the data that our feather uploaded into adafruit IO into a googlesheet ( account 3 ) that is thus is with the help of an add-on from theXS mapping linked to google maps, it might be simpler (that does not mean easier but in the end maybe less time-intensive) to go back to open-source services. Such as leaflets that are explainend very well by some GitHub people willing to share their knowledge and OpenStreetMap that is in contrary to google-maps a map that is built on the data users voluntarily feed it with.

Here I will reflect on my personal workflow that was reelated to the GPS programming and the online linkages. we translate a cardboard prototype into Rhino to be 3D printed. We do this all together, giving feedback on assembling, practicality, function and measurements and combining small dots of knowledges we have between the three of us. We export it as an st-file and set up the CURA-file to print it in the 3D-printers over night. It takes two printing trials and the new designs I start over with grasshopper to be able to adapt the digital model according to the changing measurements of all the electronics that need to fit it. In another night way later on, we print another version which turns out good - as we want it for now. so then to the GPS first things first, is it possible? I talk with Victor: what we need is to record the geolocation and the time (through a GPS in the device). There needs to be featherboard in the device. On the featherbaord, we connect a GPS that will give us the data of the geolocation and time. Then, we have to link that data to a webpage or a existing map in order t create a QR code that can be translated into a stamp and will lead to that digital interfacec. This means, we meed to access a public webserver. The question is, through which server / which computer will we be able t translate the data from the feather onto the digital platform (map\u2026)? could be a this is mqtt (which works via publish and subscribe) technique. ok, it seems possible. With the help of Edu, I compile the hardware needed to obtain a GPS signal. I use our adafruiit featherboard and a Qwiic GPS SparkFun . We install some libraries linked to this specific GPS into our arduino app and run a few different example codes to see what we get. After few trials, it works (we have to leave the building though to get our location). So we have a GPS that gives us the date, time, longitute and altitude data. This now has to be translatetd from the feather and arduino, to a digital platform. It also has to work on battery if we want it to be portable. The part that was supposed to be the most easy part (translating the GPS data into a digital platform and into a simple data-sheet) turned out to take us a whole morning of searching in old codes, reading and watching tutorials and mixing it up to create our own code. Without Daphne and all her patience this would have never worked out. And then the end of course Victor who came for half an hour and brough some order into our chaos - and siehe da , the code works.

(explanation of unknown names and words are following): \u2022 it sets up a wifi (because we wont have a sim-card in our stamp but in order to load the data directly into the digital world, a wireless connection is needed) - thus there is the possibility of chosinng a mobile-hotspot or to add the credentials of a local wifi. \u2022 it links the feather (GPS) to the adafruit IO server AND a personal account (that is needed to later on work with the date in multiple ways). So for this we made our adarfuit IO account and connect our feather ESP32. To test if there is a stable connection, we make the built in LED blink before we continue with our arduino code. \u2022 it sets up an MQTT that in our case equals our adafruit account. The MQTT in a network protocol, a language to enable the exchange of messages from remote locations and the digital (very important for the Internet of Things ). \u2022 furthermore we set up a button function to make sure that the GPS data is not being uploaded onto our digital platform constantly but only when we push. = bool butState part in the code. We make sure that the publishing function is being activated when the button is pushed and released. I have done some research on platforms that enable us to map our feather data in on online-and-real-time-updating map (to be an issue!). We try out various road. The adafruit IO WipperSnapper offers a mapping fuction, yet it turns out that they use another GPS-sensor and when trying to work with their file, it does nto run because our GPS is not a FONA GPS . To rewrite their code with our Qwiic GPS SparkFun seems a bit overwhelming, after a few trials, we leave it to that and search for something else. we still use the adafruit IO account with two feeds (one for longitude and one for latitude) and one dashboard (in which both are combined) . This is to get the data from the feather into the digital. Now we can see digitally appearing in the adafruit IO feeds the longitude, latitude, date and time when we push the buttom that is linked to the feather. In the end, we use the Adafruit IO only as a first translation to the online world and thus we only need one feed (no dasshboard or different feeds). For that, we rewrite our code just a tiny bit and sent latiude,longitude -data as one line to our longitude feed . And this feed can be linked to a google-sheet in which the data will appear clear and organized. The platform IFTTT offers multiple ways to link data to online services. One of them is the linkage of adafruit account to a googlsheet. And in google again, their googlemaps has a mymaps function. In this, we can create a \u201cprivate\u201d map that be can publish but with which we can subscribe to a google spreadsheet that we make (from our drive). Problem: the map is not updated automatically, neither is the spreadsheet (yet) meaning we have to update the map manually in order to update the pins on the map. So what we need is a way, code, trick to automate the data-translation from GPS to google spreadsheet AND a real-life update from google spreadsheet to the map created in mymaps. A little research further we stumple upon a googlesheet add-on from theXS mapping whose service offers us to mapp the data of our googlesheet in real-time in their maps - whose are linked to google maps (yet it somehow isnt mymaps anymore - however - XSmaps is fine by me). This seems to automate the process from spread-sheet to map - first moment of succcess = we see the coordinates on the map as little pins. Little downer, this automated process updates only hourly (if you dont pay for a pro-account) - not in real real time. But ok, es lo que hay. Somewhere we need to make compromises it seems. In IFTTT we edit out applet (which is just the name IFTTT gave to the linking-process). We edit and say if: there is new data in the adadfruit longitude feed, then add a new row into the latitude googlesheet in our drive (folder - location). Dont get confused with the names - its all a but messed up we know. summed up: we have a button that, when pushed, sends a GPS location to an adafruit IO account with the feed longitude . Via IFTTT, we send the data into a googlesheet which uses the XSmapping add-on to drop pins at the GPS data (updating it every hour). Furhermore, a audio-file is being played and a QR-code is being stamped. combining speaker, GPS and button the final code combines a push-button with a GPS and a Speaker that played audio from a SD-card: #include <SparkFun_I2C_GPS_Arduino_Library.h> //Use Library Manager or download here: https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun_I2C_GPS_Arduino_Library I2CGPS myI2CGPS; //Hook object to the library #include <TinyGPS++.h> //From: https://github.com/mikalhart/TinyGPSPlus TinyGPSPlus gps; //Declare gps object #include <Wire.h> #include <WiFi.h> #include \"Adafruit_MQTT.h\" #include \"Adafruit_MQTT_Client.h\" #include \"Arduino.h\" #include \"DFRobotDFPlayerMini.h\" #define WLAN_SSID \"Iaac-Wifi\" #define WLAN_PASS \"EnterIaac22@\" #define AIO_SERVER \"io.adafruit.com\" #define AIO_SERVERPORT 1883 #define AIO_USERNAME \"IO username\" #define AIO_KEY \"IO key\" #define RXD2 16 #define TXD2 17 WiFiClient client; HardwareSerial mySoftwareSerial(2); DFRobotDFPlayerMini myDFPlayer; void printDetail(uint8_t type, int value); const char MQTT_SERVER[] PROGMEM = AIO_SERVER; const char MQTT_USERNAME[] PROGMEM = AIO_USERNAME; const char MQTT_PASSWORD[] PROGMEM = AIO_KEY; // Setup the MQTT client class by passing in the WiFi client and MQTT server and login details.

That again requires a battery. And well, as we are working with wifi (wether that is a local source or a hotspot connection), the battery will pretty soon be dead because it will constantly search for signals around. To solvve that problem, josep helps me to programm the device so that only when pushing the button, the battery will turn on, it will search for wifi, connect with MQTT and with that send data to the Adafruit IO before after waiting for a few seconds it will fall to sleep again. In arduino itself, there is an example code called ExternalWakeUp. This is how you find it: our favorite tutorial for this ! well, so we try this out a few times untill it works and then combine it with our code for the GPS and audio. It does not work anymore. Bueno, we recognize, that it might take some time for the wifi to connect and the MQTT to establish a connection to we programm some delays so our MOC will not go to sleep again too soon. Now it works. problem when assembling our handy device, it appears that in the end all our electroics are too much for the 3D printed model of our portable stamp. With battery and speaker and feather and GPS and all the cables it get pretty crowded and stuffed in there. As soon as we close it off, the conenction fails - probably one of the thousand little colourful cables got lost their pins and schwups , everything is broken. After a few trials we decide to take out the microphone. We anyway have an issue with its sound-file, somehow it does not perfectly play the whole piecce and our \u201cthat\u2019s soooo colonial\u201d sentence gets a bit lost. So, we (for now) decide to focus on the essentials, the stamp, the QR-code and the GPS-signal for the map. therefore, our code shrinks a bit and looks like this: /* Deep Sleep with External Wake Up ===================================== This code displays how to use deep sleep with an external trigger as a wake up source and how to store data in RTC memory to use it over reboots This code is under Public Domain License.

Overall, the digital industry is a MESS \u2013 there has for a long time not been a sharing of files, a sharing of a same language. therefore, we have a lot of different programs and languages that are used. but nowadays, different CAD softwares can output standard models that can be read by many other softwares. talking about the basics of computing, the basics I should understand to design and print digitally on various axes. what makes a computer is the CPU and the GPU\u2026 CPU (central processing unit) very smart in doing heavy difficult mathematical equation, one after another: one operation that is very heavy and GPU (graphic processing unit) on the other hand is not so smart but can calculate a lot of small operations further vocabularies: Vector = a mathematical equation a geometric description of an image = it is one operation (read by CPU) No need for a lot of storage because what is being storage is just the equation Pixel = is a square, located in a x-y grid. One image is actually a lot of pixels that are being put together (read by GPU) \u2013 each pixel is made up of RGB sub-pixels\u2026 You need a lot of data because all the pixels in the raster have to be stored WHEN TO USE WHAT? a capturing device (camera for photo or movie) will always make pixel-raster. rather than when you 2D/ 3D-model, you always try to model in vector \u2013 why? because here we can enlarge and reduce the image in all directions infinitely (whereas if you zoom into pixels, at one point the pixels will show) SO to summarize: vectors are light files that can be enlarged and reduced without losing quality BUT often it needs to be translated into pixels so we can actually see it even more wordings: sRGB: color space of red, green and blue \u2013 currently the defined standard in the web. (1999 by HP and Microsoft) Adobe RGB space: especially suitable for editing high-quality images and photos for subsequent conversion to CMYK (CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW , BLACK that is used for printing the colors that computer screens display in RGB values) resolution: how many pixels define your image in horizontal and in vertical PPI: pixel per inch: 1 inch = 2,54 cm. So the PPI describe the amount of pixels in a 2,54 cm square. NURBS modelling (Non Uniform Rational B-Splines: defines vectors, we can built a surface through lines between points \u2013 curves. Control points in space that define shape \u2013 good for fluid shapes with a lot of complexity and at the same time easy to modify (through the points) CPU \u2013 you need a powerful CPU Mesh modelling: a collection of vertices (points in space), edges, and faces GPU \u2013 you just need a fast-pace operation tool able to handle a lot 3D scanners are always meshes, because they measure points and faces in the space Preferred modelling-method for manufacturing A story\u2026 that I must research. Historically, male persons where hunting behind mammoth and needed to orient themselves in space, the females were searching for fruit and nuts and needed to separate colors so they could define better healthy and nutritious food sources over those that are old and rotten. I am not so sure about that\u2026 ARE THESE TOOLS HELP US MODELLING FOR THE FUTURE? topology optimization (TO) is a mathematical method, a way to design with a set of rules (very complex mathematical equations) for a structural calculation. here, we start with a mass of material and take out everything that is not necessary Strong as possible by being light as possible. the goal here is to maximum force, minimal material, shortened design process what is topology? the term network topology refers to the arrangements, either physical or logical, of nodes and connections within a network \u201cTopology studies properties of spaces that are invariant under any continuous deformation. It is sometimes called \u201crubber-sheet geometry\u201d because the objects can be stretched and contracted like rubber, but cannot be broken. For example, a square can be deformed into a circle without breaking it, but a figure 8 cannot\u201d e.g. a highly opotimized frame of a motorbike will looke like full of holes: another method used in future design is: generative design where we start not from a design but from nothing. here, we let the computer make the design to propose the design; we set up parameters for the design-proceess and the program proposes a design process to design. algorithms are used here to set up the parameters e.g. all WeWork spaces are interior-designed with the aid of generative design to assure the best conditions for users this generative design is even more optimized than topology optimization . the results might be similar but the generative design is faster and consumes less resources (energy). what is a parametric design ? a parametric design is a type of design in which the shape, size, or other aspects of the design can be easily adjusted or modified by changing a set of parameters or variables. here, a design can be customized based on specific inputs or requirements (@grasshopper. this is made possible by using computer-aided design (CAD) software that allow you to specify a set of parameters and relationships between them as for example: Tinkercad: simple interface, variety of shapes and components Fusion 360: more advanced 3D design tool, robust set of features, great for creating complex designs OpenSCAD: open-source 3D modeling software that is primarily used for creating parametric designs, uses a script-based approach, which makes it great for creating repetitive shapes or objects exercise two - parametrizing a croissant \u00b6 parametrize means to describe or represent in terms of choosen variables (parameters) grasshopper for example is a parametric program that makes rhino models parametrically adaptable great, my handdrawing are quick and easily understandable. to get a grip on something digital, I play with grasshopper (in rhino) to translate my sketches into (possibly) a printed (for sure plantbased) edition of my croissant? closer into bidimensional (2D) fabrication \u00b6 with edu, josep, petra and others Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) what can you do with a laser cutter? it heats materials through directing high power through optics. various kinds of applying later-fabrications are: pressfit (hold the pieces together just by pressure), stacking, interlocking (waffle), living hinge (pure geometry that makes something hard very flexible), material welding, origami, electronics, what materials . does the laser handle? low density materials such as plastics, wood, cardboard, fabrics, in general all organic materials and (non-organic) plastics there are three (actually two) laser cutting processes Engrave (burning a lot of material next to each other) and Marking (burning a line of material) are actually the same - burning a bit if material cutting I always have to make a digital fabrication to get from CAD to CAM from laser cut to vinyl cut what is the difference? on a vinyl cutter, we dont have a x-y axis like in the laser cutte, here we have a right-left movement where the material is being applied onto. but here there exist other parameters we can adapt: speed, force, and durance of application. exercise three - lasercutting simulations \u00b6 somehow since the presentation of edu, the origami simulator really caught my eye. not that I am a great origami practitioner, its actually quite the opposite, I am very impatient and not precise at all, so the thought of folding tiny papers into tiny figures is not really appealing to be. but I love to watch them, hold them, see them beign folded. the origami-simulator is designed by an amanda who very helping explains how things work and offer some example files on her github page . yet to understand all of this, it took some time and to figure out, that files can be created and adapted in rhino to work in the simulator, took some more. to explain my experience in short, amanda has some example files that I downloaded and than imitated and adapted in variuos ways. the simulations then show how my rhino-drawing would fold and unfold if it would be paper. well not excactly, sometimes the simulation folds throgh and in if I out the simulations speed on very fast or somehow part just fly away, out of the screen sometimes as well. Well, i had some beautiful results playing around with exploding and colorcoding in various ways. and also then I lasercut and vinylprinted the sphere designs and in the end spend a lot of time folding paper\u2026 who had thought that would happen\u2026 I also use this newly learned skill in the challenge-week for the MOC with my team. on a more practical note, the online simulator reads SVGs in a certain way (File - Design Tips on the simulator (Mountain folds have red stroke - rgb(255, 0, 0), hex #ff0000; Valley folds have blue stroke - rgb(0, 0, 255), hex #0000ff; Boundary edges have black stroke - rgb(0, 0, 0), hex #000000). these rules are different to those I use during the the lasercuttring and the vinylprinting process. here I define the actions and allocate them to the colors of choice - so in the end, the colours I use for the simulation-SVGs are fine to. but its important to keep in mind that the simulation SVGs do not necessarily have the same color-codes as the rhino-files used for printing. about embedded codings (or how to use input and output sensors) \u00b6 with Victor how can all this codings and electronics in the end serve us? there is one project that started in the FabLab / MDEF environment some years ago which presents this very clearly - the smart citizen platform makes citizens use sensors to invesitgate their immediate environments (well still thats not a purspose but it might still as well as inspire some interests). so what we are talking about today is how to connect the elcetronic means in ways that we understand the information shown. meaning in other words to sense and input and make us observe and output as an example and excercies, we are playing with light sensors and try to code in a way so we know the amount (or strenght?) of the light, reaching the sensor. so in a way we can dimm the light once we would add a controll function. but for now it is just about setting up the featherboard in a way that a photo receptive sensor which receives light information (thus a light sensors ) and translates that into elecrticity that therefore gives another sign/ output (such as the lightening of an LED light or the making of a sound). so in the end we connect a LED and a button and a photo receptive sensor. then we make the light signal appeearing as a \u201cmorse code\u201d and connect the LED sensor with the photo recepting sensor. easy. no? exercise four - till the enlightment \u00b6 all of this works similar to the ghost machiene that we created last term. But yeah, that has been some time ago and the main coder here was definetely Amanda, without her the ghost would have remained unsensed forever. ok back to the basics. this lovely youtuber sets me back on track on how to arduino and how to LED - without sensor for now. Let make it blink for now\u2026 now I am working with the timing, in order to get acquaintance with the morse-code thingy\u2026 as my youtube Kylie shows me its actually not that difficult to implement. and here you have your puzzle, what am I communicating to you? I even made my syntax complex according to the international morse code one and not my simple youtube reference\u2026 and believe me or not, after few failures it works (proud) well, I guess now there is no postponing anymore. lets introduce the sensor, at least one is already plugged on my board, it cannot be so far from here. I already tried earlier with this example from arduino . But as often as I assembled my board anew and checked the code and the pins, it would not work for me. now I come back to it and figure out, that somehow on my board, I need to still wire the ground to he blue, the negative vein. well, thinking for oneself sometimes helps, just blindly copying never works it seems. so, here we are, since the beginning I just copied their image, now I linked the LED, the sensors and the transmitters with my own little mind. and siehe da\u2026 my LED shines bright. and when I put my finger on the sensor, it shines a little bit less bright. not yet so much, but it dimms the light I can see it! here even better, can you see it? well, I can so, the set up that works for me is this one, which is inspired f the official arduino one to its right okay, now I just somehow have to combine my morse-experience with the light-sensor output right? well, for another day, its night by now. int LED = 25; int unit = 200; // this is just according the the international morse code syntax to make it easier to write int dot = 200; // int dash = 600; // three units according to the inernational morsse code syntax int letterGap = 600; // seven units according to the inernational morsse code syntax int wordGap = 1400; // seven units according to the inernational morsse code syntax void setup() { // put your setup code here, to run once: pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); //make pin A3 output } void loop() { // put your main code here, to run repeatedly: switchLED(dash); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); delay(wordGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dash); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); delay(wordGap); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); } void switchLED(int timing) { digitalWrite(LED, LOW); delay (timing); digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); delay (timing); } ah and just f you wondered if you were right, reading my message\u2026 you were \u201cto all my heroes\u201d the first microchallenge \u00b6 in the first micro-challenge week we are asked to implement the skills we theorized so far about \u2026 like lasercutting and vinylprinting, parametrics and press fit designs, how to code arduino sensors and more. my personal work evolves around storytelling, making up spaces for voices to resonate in and miking up the circles people find themselves thinking with. as I am in the MDEF programm at the moment working with myrto 24/7, we decided to took the chance to step back from our togetherness and let ourselves go with tthe flow of some other ideas. Marielle and Carolina had already found each other and merged their POC-experience-frustrations into a concrete idea of working with the ignorance of white people towards the statues of colonizers and their histories in the city (BCN). in my theoretical thoughworld I am dealing a lot with (de)colonial practices and anyways, this means re-telling stories and giving voice, so I stepped in to become the white addative to our multiracial team. here you go, enjoy the presentation of the first micro challenge . about 3D fabrication and scanning \u00b6 with Edu 3D printing \u00b6 What options exist in 3D production? Additive manufacturing technologies: Working with Metal: DMLS (direct metal laser sintering) / SLM (selective laser melting) / DMP (direct metal printing) Working with resin: SLA (stereolithography) Specific machine that works with paper LOM (laminated object manufacturing - almost unknown) paper printer with a cut out and then millions of layers on top oof each other. Used for aesthetics reasons because you can get very high resolution outcomes Subtractive manufacturing technologies: CNC machining (computerized numerical control): It is a computerized manufacturing process in which pre-programmed software and code controls the movement of production equipment (ex. mills, lathes, routers, grinders and lasers) More about the history of 3D printing I already describe here . But the essentials again: the 3D printer bible . Subtractive vs additive comparison The workflow with 3D printings\u2026 First we need a 3D model (exactly) Then we have the slicer settings - we need to slice our model into horizontal pieces (Slicing STTL file) Then we have the printer limitations and the material that we can use (data) Built your 3D model as a bone \u2013 a shell and a infill, to safe material and to allow for faster production (printing) Structural strength often comes with less material that are designed in complex dimensionals The most classic ones are: rectangular, triangular or diagrid, wiggle and honeycomb. We can change the structural strength of an object by adapting, changing its infill - here the goal is to make the material more isotropic. Isotropic: having a physical property which has the same value when measured in different directions vs. Anisotropic: exhibiting properties with different values when measured in different directions. What we will use withing FabLab? FDM (fused deposition modeling) a 3D printing machine Two versions: 1. direct driven \u2013 direct driven machine are better but slower, here, the motor is directly at the nosel. You can only print hard materials, not flexible ones 2. Bowden driven \u2013 these machines have a cord to allow the nosel to move farther away 3D scanning \u00b6 What is 3D scanning as a concept? Being able to represent the real world in a digital environment \u2013 3D scanning built on all the experiences humanity has made up to capture reality (painting, camera obscura\u2026) how to draw geometrics? Emergence of mathematical solutions with trigonometric (math) \u2013 setting up rules for distances and spaces. Nowadays, 3Dd scanning works by pure geometry and trigonometry. google Earth uses 3D scanner with satellites and airplanes. What is nerve modeling? Vector interpolations \u2013 how the lines are interconnected. What is mesh modelling? Points located in the space. With a 3D scanner we are calculating the points in the space \u2013 reading the mesh. Not the nerves. Different 3D print techniques\u2026 SLS scanner (Structured light scanners) \u2013 extremely accurate and offer high resolution. They can be very fast. They use cameras and expose a lot of light, therefore they are not good to use to scan humans (bad for eyes\u2026) Downside, you have to rotate you object yourself in the machine Laser scanner \u2013 similar concept as the SLS but most f the time handheld \u2013 so you can move it around the object. This cannot scan colors but only shapes. LiDAR scanner \u2013 also a laser but works with a different concept: Time of Flight. We use the time the light takes to travel to the object and to be bounced back from the object -we measure the distances. We have a laser-pointer and we move and project the laser onto the object. Downside, you cannot scan far with accuracy. With LiDAR we can scan terrains, topographic maps. Because of the interplay between sunlight on plants and the laser (too fast and complex for me to understand completely but still very interesting) the leaves are invisible to the laser camera and thus one can capture whole environments/ forests\u2026 and make topographic analysis. Digiprobe scanner \u2013 it is a switch, we have a pen with a switch and wen we touch the switch, it stores the value of the location. Touch digi \u2013 with this pen you can decide exactly which parts of an object you want to scan, capture. With this you can check specific parts. This is a CNM machine (manually able to decide where to put the pen) Sometimes you spray your objects before scanning them via photogrammetry. Photogrammetry relies on computer exercise five - the croissant becomes tangible (maybe) \u00b6 to come back to my vegan croissants (on which the grasshoppers are munching) I export my rhino file as obj and upload it into the ultimaker cura . looks magnificent, a black croissant\u2026 then I put some setting because my croissant it quite floating in the air, it needs a support structure (I let cura generate how and what\u2019s important here). Then I slice it up, cura tells me it will take 19 hours to print\u2026 in order to reduce that time, I scale down my objects. it is gonna be a tiny croissant, 50 mm (perfect size for grasshoppers I think). furthermore I reduce the density of the object and the support structure. okay, I slice it anew, 2,5 hours. that fine. I guess. to the 3D printer\u2026 I set up the 3D printer, by heating up the nosel to insert my material (PML) - I want the most simple easy ging one because this is just a trial print in order to print (whatever sense in here? I am still figuring out). so once the PML-threat is loaded, I upload my cura -file onto the SD-card of the printer, insert it back into the printer and press print croissant. I come back after a nice session of bouldering and unfortunately find out that my croisssant did not even make it to the baking point\u2026 Amanda (my hero) hints me towards adding a raft - a plate adhesion which is essentially a plate ontop of which the support and the croissant can be built onto because according to Amanda, the structure had to little hold on the slippery plate of the 3D printer. okay, so I edit my settings and built a plate addhesion as a raft. reduce its density in order to safe time and slice it up in cura . about three hours it calculates. bueno, I set the SD-card and printer, press print and leave it printing over night\u2026 excited to come in the morning and yes, in the morning, freshly baked, I am finding my croissant very sticked to the plate of the printer. Edu explains me, that a he hasnt been ussing rafts since years. rafts are for very complicated models, my little croissant definetely isnt. however, heaing up the bed a little helps me to sratch it off and then I break off the support and here e voila, the croissant is there. about networking \u00b6 with Victor the internet \u2013 a copy machine? actually what it does is just copying information (bits) from one place to another. Location: it is not possible to perform all processing/calculation orr hardware management tasks in the same site \u2013 four knot points on the world where all data are flowing through. Parallelism: you can do, process multiple things at the same time Modularity: about systems and distribution of humans, make developments in modules, each with a very specific function, easily scalable and more easily repairable Access: human acccess to data from all computers wherever they are The cloud does not exist, only hard drives on other people computers. Dissociation between what\u2019s happening here in reality and in the digital reality There is a (real) network . the physical layer / manifestation of the transmission of information / data and there are *protocol*s \u2013 agreement on how networks are communicating. A set of rules of who can speak at what time. We have physical layers and nonphysical rules. My conversation with ChatGPT An internet node, also known as a network node or internet exchange point, is a physical location where internet service providers (ISPs), content providers, and other networks interconnect to exchange internet traffic. It is difficult to provide an exact number of internet nodes worldwide since the number is constantly changing and evolving. However, there are many internet node directories available online that list various internet nodes around the world. One of the largest internet node directories is PeeringDB , which currently lists over 9,000 network operators and over 8,000 peering locations around the world. Internet nodes can be found in major cities and metropolitan areas worldwide. Some of the largest internet exchange points in terms of traffic volume include the AMS-IX in Amsterdam, the DE-CIX in Frankfurt, the LINX in London, the Equinix IX in Ashburn, Virginia, and the China Telecom CNIX in Beijing. It\u2019s worth noting that the number and location of internet nodes can change over time as new networks emerge, and existing networks expand or contract. network topologies from centralization to distributed hubs - networks of networks adressess redirecting to adressess redirecting to adressses wired vs. wireless communication wired: you need physical stuff (copper, aluminium) to sent electric signals. because cmoputers are faster than what cables can transmitt, there are parallel ports that take in a lot of cables parallely and serial ports that take series of data (USB = universal serial bus) Parallel interfaces transfer multiple bits at the same time. They usually require buses of data - transmitting across eight, sixteen, or more wires. This means that waves of data can be sent, with high speeds, but with a lot of wires. On the contrary, serial interfaces stream their data with a reference signal, one single bit at a time. These interfaces can operate on as little as one wire, usually never more than four wireless: over the air communication (OTA) of data - here, use the different various frequencies of signals (@radio frequency spectrum ranges) am (amplitude modulation) fm (frequency modulation) what it the difference with AM radio, the amplitude, or overall strength, of the signal is varied to incorporate the sound information. with FM, the frequency (the number of times each second that the current changes direction) of the carrier signal is varied. exercise six - a MDEF internal whatsap \u00b6 we are all using the same broker (laptop of victor) about how to make simple things complex (an LED) \u00b6 or on Interfaces: machine vs machine with Edu and Oscar what can we do with a simple LED ? why would we? oscar makes us enthiusastic telling us how he collaborates with dance companies. Here is Hackmd excercise seven - blinkin with complexities \u00b6 1.0 blink \u00b6 simply, make it blink. the code for 1.0 blink: /* Blink Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly. */ // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board #define LED 14 //int LED = 14; practically these two have the same output put they come to the result in different ways. void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second } 2.0 blink by command \u00b6 great next. Now we gonna write a code to ask for constent, we want to be asked before the LED is starting to blink. in order to do so, we are using the serial monitor and tell the arduino to do something only in the moment we tell him. it is like a chat between me and the arduino, with the serial monitor as out communication platform. how do we do that? we write a code and the open the serial monitor, and write in there the commant blink and (according to what we coded), my arduino will excecute the command - and will blink. 2.0 blink by command. first it does not work. Our internal communication (the serial monitor) does not respond to my commands. Oscar explains that I need to set up the serial monitor in technical term so that the USB connection does understand. Instead of the new line I change the settings to both NL & CR and the set to 9600 baud . Now, I works, if I say blink , my arduino blinks. serial.begins = is the communicaion with the USB (universal serial bus). So the speed (in brackets) has to be aliigned between the arduino and our featherboard. now it works, if I say blink fast , tthe arduino blinks fast (because I created a hopping function ). the code for 2.0 blink by command: #include \"Arduino.h\" #define LED_PIN 14 // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT); Serial.begin(9600); } void blink () { digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second } void hopping () { digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { if (Serial.available()) { String newMsg = Serial.readString(); newMsg.trim(); Serial.print(\"Got new message!: \"); Serial.println(newMsg); // blink if we tell it to! if (newMsg.equals(\"blink\")){ blink(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"blink fast\")){ hopping(); } } } now, this is very inefficient, our code has a lot of lines and will probably only grow till the point that it is so heavy the featherboard cannot hold it anymore and the arduino function does not work. so we are now working toward fully parametrizing our functions as much as possisble\u2026 3.0 blink and breathe \u00b6 working with a jled library to make our LED breathe (slowly dimming on and dimming off) the code for 3.0 blink and breathe: #include \"Arduino.h\" #include \"jled.h\" #define LED_PIN 14 // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. Serial.begin(9600); } // Jled object. // More information here: https://github.com/jandelgado/jled#usage JLed led = JLed(LED_PIN); // Basic blink void blink () { led.Blink(1000, 600).Repeat(3); } // Smooth breathing void breathe() { led.Breathe(1000).Repeat(3); } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { if (Serial.available()) { // Read the string and clean it up String newMsg = Serial.readString(); newMsg.trim(); // For debugging purposes, print it Serial.print(\"Got new message!: \"); Serial.println(newMsg); // Blink if we tell it to! if (newMsg.equals(\"blink\")){ blink(); // Or breathe! } else if (newMsg.equals(\"breathe\")) { breathe(); } } // Do not remove this line! led.Update(); } 4.0 blinking over the network \u00b6 like we tried last week with victor, we are using the MQTT (a protocol that is used in a lot of internet of thing - IOT devices) which is used for us to trigger to sensors and allows us to listen the output. instead of relying on a cable, we talk via the wifi network existing and we listen all together to the same things. in this case it means we are commanding either breathe or blink and all featherboards in class (that managed to connect the wifi-code in their arduino) will see their LEDs lighting up. what needs to be done: defining the wifi network (we/oour featherboards are all connected to) and our name/our featherboaords name\u2026 the code for 4.0 blinking over the network: #include \"jled.h\" #define LED_PIN 14 // New code for MQTT! //------------------- #include <WiFi.h> #include <PubSubClient.h> const char* ssid = \"Iaac-Wifi\"; const char* password = \"EnterIaac22@\"; WiFiClient wifiClient; const char* mqttBroker = \"mqtt-staging.smartcitizen.me\"; const char* mqttClientName = \"s&c\"; const char* mqttClientUser = \"fablabbcn102\"; const char* mqttClientPass = \"\"; const char* topicToSub = \"lab\"; // const char* topicToPub = \"lab\"; PubSubClient mqttClient(wifiClient); //------------------- // Jled object. // More information here: https://github.com/jandelgado/jled#usage JLed led = JLed(LED_PIN); //------------------- // Add more animations here! // Basic blink void blink () { led.Blink(1000, 600).Repeat(3); } // Smooth breathing void breathe() { led.Breathe(1000).Repeat(3); } //------------------- void mqttConnect() { while (!mqttClient.connected()) { Serial.print(\"Attempting MQTT connection...\"); if (mqttClient.connect(mqttClientName, mqttClientUser, mqttClientPass)) { Serial.println(\"connected\"); mqttClient.publish(\"hello\", mqttClientName); // Topic(s) subscription mqttClient.subscribe(topicToSub); } else { Serial.print(\"failed, rc=\"); Serial.print(mqttClient.state()); Serial.println(\" try again in 5 seconds\"); delay(5000); } } } void callback(char* topic, byte* message, unsigned int length) { String newMsg; for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) { newMsg += (char)message[i]; } Serial.print(\"Message arrived on topic: \"); Serial.print(topic); Serial.print(\".

Serial.begin(9600); // Connect to wifi WiFi.begin(ssid, password); while (WiFi.status() != WL_CONNECTED) { delay(500); Serial.print(\".\"); } Serial.print(\"Connected to \"); Serial.println(ssid); Serial.print(\"IP address: \"); Serial.println(WiFi.localIP()); // MQTT setup mqttClient.setServer(mqttBroker, 1883); mqttClient.setCallback(callback); } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { // Check if we are still connected to the MQTT broker if (!mqttClient.connected()) { mqttConnect(); } // Let PubSubClient library do his magic mqttClient.loop(); // Do not remove this line! led.Update(); } 5.0 blinking together with arguments \u00b6 great, can we make this part even a bit more complex? maybe with a slider so we can adapt the speed (intensity) of the function (either blink or breathe)? what we need to code an argument so a broker can translate within the network. again we need to change the wifi network (we/oour featherboards are all connected to) credentials and add our name/our featherboaords names. the code for 5.0 blinking together with arguments: #include \"Arduino.h\" #include \"jled.h\" #define LED_PIN 14 // New code for MQTT! //------------------- #include <WiFi.h> #include <PubSubClient.h> const char* ssid = \"Iaac-Wifi\"; const char* password = \"EnterIaac22@\"; WiFiClient wifiClient; const char* mqttBroker = \"mqtt-staging.smartcitizen.me\"; const char* mqttClientName = \"c&s\"; const char* mqttClientUser = \"fablabbcn102\"; const char* mqttClientPass = \"\"; const char* topicToSub = \"lab\"; // const char* topicToPub = \"lab\"; PubSubClient mqttClient(wifiClient); //------------------- // Jled object. // More information here: https://github.com/jandelgado/jled#usage JLed led = JLed(LED_PIN); //------------------- // Add more animations here! // Basic blink void blink (int time_on = 100) { led.Blink(time_on, time_on).Repeat(3); } // Smooth breathing void breathe(int time_on = 100) { led.Breathe(time_on).Repeat(3); } //------------------- // burn void burn(int time_on = 100) { led.Candle(time_on).Repeat(3); } //------------------- void mqttConnect() { while (!mqttClient.connected()) { Serial.print(\"Attempting MQTT connection...\"); if (mqttClient.connect(mqttClientName, mqttClientUser, mqttClientPass)) { Serial.println(\"connected\"); mqttClient.publish(\"hello\", mqttClientName); // Topic(s) subscription mqttClient.subscribe(topicToSub); } else { Serial.print(\"failed, rc=\"); Serial.print(mqttClient.state()); Serial.println(\" try again in 5 seconds\"); delay(5000); } } } void callback(char* topic, byte* message, unsigned int length) { String newMsg; for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) { newMsg += (char)message[i]; } // Serial.print(\"Message arrived on topic: \"); // Serial.print(topic); // Serial.print(\".

CNC can mill in various ways: with a 3-axis CNC: type of milling where the cutting tool moves along three axes (X, Y, and Z) to remove material from the workpiece. can be done with either a milling machine or a turning machine. or with multi-axis CNC: type of milling that uses machines with more than four or five axiss to achieve greater precision and complexity in the machined part. three subtypes: indexed milling: cutting tool moves along multiple fixed positions to achieve complex shapes continuous milling: the cutting tool moves along a continuous path to achieve smooth surfaces and complex contours mill-turning: a single machine combines the functions of both milling and turning to achieve complex shapes in a single setup another category, a handheld/guided machine. this one can not be automated completely but it allows for manual works and helps. this machine is only as accurrate, as you, the user are. (only for planar cuts - not very handy for 3 dimensional or very detailed works) what are the parts of the CNC? T-Slot Table: Provides a stable surface for holding the workpiece. Spindle: Rotates the cutting tool and feeds it into the workpiece to remove material. Bridge: Connects the X and Y-axis components and provides stability to the machine. Steppers: Move the cutting tool along the X, Y, and Z-axis with high precision. Cable Carrier: Protects and organizes the electrical cables that run between the machine components. when using the CNC it is important to respect some safety rules. the CNC cuts out which means that material will be turned into dustt and chips and will fly around in the air. depending on the material used, this implies some issues such as health threats, inflamability\u2026 how to design for the CNC entonces? they call this process (because everything needs acronyms) CNC DFM (Design for Manufacturing) these 50 digital joint poster is Edu\u2019s bible excercise eight - \u00b6 hello","title":"digital prototyping"},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#_1","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 14 - 20/ 01 February - 17 March 2023 prototyping for design with Edu, Victor, Santi, Josep, Aida and Petra (somehow) unexpectadly this course turned out to be a series of intense lectures with subsequent (self-)explorative adapation trials. theoretically we are introduced to the huge fields of advanced manufacturing, rapid prototyping and other new design methodologies by victor and edu that really did their best to hold us up motivated. we are very much encouraged to play around with the various tools accessible to us and make up some (hands-on? - the computer) experiences with digital fabrication tools. when we come to the micro-challenge-week we actually explorer what it means to physicalize digital realities\u2026","title":""},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#about-electronics-and-codings","text":"with Victor with victor we party continued our conversation of transparentizing blackboxes we started off last term. similarly in in the coding world, a lot of things are kept in the dark and made complicated so users use user-oriented-design products that prevent individual agency through mystifying easy things. arduino is one of these projects that work for a transparent electronics as they aim to make coding more accessible to public and are all in for collective knowledges. we often consider Arduino being the wired-board that allows us to physicalize our codes yet actually arduino is a small organization that exists off tree complementary parts: the hardware, the software, and the community. their easy-to-handle softwares, can be used with any kind of hardware and thus allows all kinds of people to try out their ideas. the best approach to prototype electronics is go with an already built prototyping electronics board \u2013 we will use ESP32 Feather board (hardware) with Arduino (software). there is a think about languages here, there are very complex coding languages but we will try to keep it easy and use the arduino standard language for used for programmings of microcontrollers which is C and C++ a very helpful other tool are the arduino libraries libraries: (arduino) libraries are folders of existing codes that are shared, it is a way to organize and contribute to the coding-functions.","title":"about electronics and codings"},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#exercise-one-making-music","text":"first things first. get the arduino (which is actually not an Arduino but a feather [board])to work. the hooking up to the system works somehow with the help of us all\u2026 the the right pins into the right holes. bueno, therefore I need to find the descriptions of the holes in the Adafruit ESP32 feather BECAAAUSE, it does not show on the thing itself\u2026 well having done this, I check the working of my code and its relation to my microcontroller\u2026 IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER HERE: choose the right port : in this case: \u201c/dev/cu.usbserial-0264F311\u201d and the right board : in this case: \u201cAdafruit ESP32 Feather\u201d ok well. with some simple codes (found in the arduino internet) I\u2019ll make it to sing some songs for me. e.g. pink panther(in a very queery high tone but whatever), happy birthday and some irrelevant other note-compositions. alright, to be honest, it is getting quite soon quite boring playing all the pre-set songs through copy paste and hitting enter. so I extetnt my Arduino\u2026 with a research on libraries\u2026 to include a new library, I open a new Arduino file, then in its menu bar I search for \u201cSketch\u201d and then Include Library > Manage Libraries . the mozzi library (nickname for Mozart???). from the GitHub page, I download via the code a zip file and follow the instructions to install it within my existing libraries. bueno thats done. yet nothing of the codes to adapt sonic output makes a sound \u2026 ?! trying my best to solve the wiring another nice application I would like to share here is our dear friend\u2019s birthday party. to avoid the typical party moment where everyone starts singing so loudly that they might drown out the others, we thought it would be nice to use our little music-making machiene instead. so we exposed the party guests to the queer sounds of the little featherboard.

They usually require buses of data - transmitting across eight, sixteen, or more wires. This means that waves of data can be sent, with high speeds, but with a lot of wires. On the contrary, serial interfaces stream their data with a reference signal, one single bit at a time.

CNC can mill in various ways: with a 3-axis CNC: type of milling where the cutting tool moves along three axes (X, Y, and Z) to remove material from the workpiece. can be done with either a milling machine or a turning machine. or with multi-axis CNC: type of milling that uses machines with more than four or five axiss to achieve greater precision and complexity in the machined part. three subtypes: indexed milling: cutting tool moves along multiple fixed positions to achieve complex shapes continuous milling: the cutting tool moves along a continuous path to achieve smooth surfaces and complex contours mill-turning: a single machine combines the functions of both milling and turning to achieve complex shapes in a single setup another category, a handheld/guided machine. this one can not be automated completely but it allows for manual works and helps. this machine is only as accurrate, as you, the user are. (only for planar cuts - not very handy for 3 dimensional or very detailed works) what are the parts of the CNC? T-Slot Table: Provides a stable surface for holding the workpiece. Spindle: Rotates the cutting tool and feeds it into the workpiece to remove material. Bridge: Connects the X and Y-axis components and provides stability to the machine. Steppers: Move the cutting tool along the X, Y, and Z-axis with high precision. Cable Carrier: Protects and organizes the electrical cables that run between the machine components. when using the CNC it is important to respect some safety rules. the CNC cuts out which means that material will be turned into dustt and chips and will fly around in the air. depending on the material used, this implies some issues such as health threats, inflamability\u2026 how to design for the CNC entonces? they call this process (because everything needs acronyms) CNC DFM (Design for Manufacturing) these 50 digital joint poster is Edu\u2019s bible","title":"about CNC fabrication"},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#excercise-eight-","text":"hello","title":"excercise eight -"},{"location":"term2/remixmaterials/remixmaterials/","text":"\u00b6 \ud83d\uddd3 Week 13&14 / 18 January - 3 February 2023 remixing materials \u00b6 with Lara Campos and Laura Freixas and Petra and Edu this week we have been introduced to a new pair of glasses to look at (bio-based) materials. approaching microorganisms, rubbish, and things our neighborhood doesn\u2019t \u201cneed\u201d through an exploration-based sensory experience showed me what experimenting with (potential) bio-based materials means. we grow our own biological base and manipulate the process and outcomes in different ways (sometimes with more control than other times). the aim is to develop a prototype for a material that can be used on a larger scale and potentially (re)take current uses. we engage in systemic design processes that include the use of local and to- hand material sources and help connect them to the socio-economic context rather than using sophisticated laboratories. material exploration \u00b6 around me I see wax on walls EMOTIONAL LOADING. the sight of this wall with messages reminds me of so many things: a hike in the mountains, a small hut and writing names and dates on the wooden plank. since we haven\u2019t thought of the need for pen or paper, the only thing left burning is a candle, whose melted wax we can carefully spread on the wood and press our fingers into. before we leave the next morning and roll up our sleeping bags, we promise that we will return to this place. in 10 years, we will meet here again, and will update our fingerprints [\u2026] we climb the many stairs to the highest tower in town. its stone walls enclose our small group, breathing heavily. at the top, the wind cools us down quickly, but we can\u2019t just climb back down yet. we want to make sure we leave a trail. with a wax crayon we paste our symbol on the stone in the upper left corner. who knows who will discover it one day. wax crayons are one of the most amazing tools to put color and words on all kinds of surfaces, one can use fingers and body heat (e.g. friction between fingers) to easily (re)define its properties.

Useful for rapid prototyping and formative manufacturing: such as injection molding and stamping, creates objects by forming or molding materials into shape with heat and/or pressure. there are more than 300 different kinds of applying various materials with 3D printing techniques. well, lets get into it\u2026","title":"3D printing with ceramics and biomaterials"},{"location":"term2/remixmaterials/remixmaterials/#clay-experimenting","text":"we mixed: 2 kilos clay + 200 ml of water (10% of the amount of clay is a good amount) then we forced it into a \u201cpump\u201d and installed the 3D printer (fully self-made by the lovely fablab people). with UltiMaker Cura we translated a very simple rhino-shape into a readable format and with a sd-card (no bluetooth or airdrop yet\u2026) to the printer-computer. and then we waited, everyone was very excited to watch the little slimy clay snake drawing its circles. and by the way, this end result was the second trial. our first one did fell during the printing process\u2026 buuuuuut however. death is part of life one could say. well and what to say more about these two weeks of experimentation?","title":"clay experimenting"},{"location":"term2/remixmaterials/remixmaterials/#abjecting-the-known","text":"with Korbi and Myrto and Marielle and the help of the cats Arthur, Bethy and Joyce this whole experiments with biomaterials were a bit difficult to me. we are trying to replace plastics from petroleum, as this is a finite resource which\u2019 extraction from earth is cause to fatal pollutions and disbalances of whole ecosystems, with more regenerative, circular materials that could serve the same purpose. yet often, plant-based materials that used in bio-plastic-experimentation such as alginates or tree-resins, are not locally accessible in the urban environment I find myself in. ingredients for experimentation are ordered from far, mixed together by us in inseparable ways and poured into forms and moulds just to look and test for a few days. however, I really acknowledge the importance of experimentation with hands to experience \u201cwith my body\u201d\u2026even if the prior incentive of promoting the circularity of life and the regenerative aspects of resources fails in the lab-context. yet still I have to say, it is not my cup of tea. but I tried my best to curiously play around and as a group we tried to adress this topic and include some awareness raising into the process of what materials we use for the making of what materials. we tried exploring a set of locally (bodily?) materials that may be under-researched because the process is often seen as \u2018disgusting\u2019, not because they are not suitable materials, but because of the growth and feeding of social boundaries (between accepted and unaccepted) that were culturally constructed and serve to maintain social order and power dynamics. we worked with the abject-theory as foundation on exploring how hair and gelatine (often considered the dead and disgusting parts of human and animal life) can be introduced into the bio-plastic-experimentation-world and what questions this would bring, what boundaries it could dissolve. the use of abjects in art often comments on cultural attitudes towards the body and its waste. similarly, we aim to push the limits of what is deemed appropriate for commercial and industrial use. by creating hair-gelatine materials (that look really not appealing) we aim to provoke a response that goes beyond traditional aesthetic enjoyment that often comes with the smooth and colourful appearance of bio-plastic-leather, algae-based paints or chia-based skincare products. here is our little presentation on abjecting the known :)) furthermore I am interested in creating sun-light-playing cubes, sculptural pieces that trigger discourse about air and solids, about places and made-up boundaries. the flexible gelatine material allowed me (after various trials to find out the right composition of gelatine and glycerin) to sew pieces together and create a small version of a cube.","title":"abjecting the known"},{"location":"term3/MDEFfest/mdeffest/","text":"\u00b6 \ud83d\uddd3 Week 24 / 17 april -

A robot works in linear and in joint-movements. The latter which is the more easy one for the robot and whith which we can just point our a point in space and the and of the arm ( the extruder) will move there. The robot we have at IAAC moves on 7 different dimensions, which can be counted by its amount of joints. If working with our IAAC robot, we have to install plug ins to our softwares (e.g. rhino & grasshopper) that help us calibrate and set up the robots we want to use\u2026 Josep provides us with some templates that we thus try out and play around with. blender \u00b6 20. april with Victor what is the best tool for the job you want to do? the thing is, in digital work you often do not really know what to do. So therefore the digital tool can be a guidance and interesting inpiraton to change the process of your work. e.g. if an image-tool has 100 filters, you will try out various options which will make your work. Blender is a free and open source 3D creation suit that is often used for animation-making and movies. During this session Victor (once again) brought us closer to the complex interrelationships of business, the open-soource world and the user and their creations. He summarized how the tools we choose force us towards determined paths - and that good and open-source softwares should allow us to determine and explore by ourself if we put the time and effort to grasp them. We are thus dependant on that which is available to us within these choices. A bit of history before we get to know how to use blender. decisions! we depend on the choices the software allows us to make. ARE WE? if we are designers and want to call us as such, we should know the software we use till the point that we can modify and use it with freedom and creativty. Otherwise, we are just \u201ctechhnical operaters\u201d of a system that makes you. About blender: In 1994 the first source file was written. This wass the inspiration for the in 2002 creation of \u201cBlender\u201d. Ton Roosendaal was one of the founders and his keynote speach is exceptionally interesting (according to Victor - fanboy ). Blender is a open sourcec software - meaning, there are rules of how to use, modify and distribute source files according to the standards of the open source concept . The open source initiative does make the rules and gives out licenses. Thus as a free alie (if I download the source file and I modify and distribut it) has to apply to the rule and publish the modified verssions under the same conitions. Because it is opensource, all money generated with the software, is being distributed to of people and not centralized and concentrated in one company. The question the remains how to design a profitable bussinesss-moodel for such a platform? Blender has a movie concept in which they collaborate with visual artists to release (cinema) movies with which they earn money. How to work with blender. the user-interface of blender is a bit strage because it is not built to SELL the software but to work on things together. The user-interface thus is a bit more complicated. this tool is not to make to learn-by-doing in an intuitive way. If considering using blender seriously, I will need to read the extensive manuals available. As an example, in blender everyone can create their own \u201ctool-board\u201d, their own windows that will be designed according to each projects need. Blender has a mode-editer, which means I can be in different modes in order to apply a different sets of operations to the data. That helps to transform any data into animations. Another important thing when working with blender on mac is to enable the numpad. Because windows has a number-pad on the right side, the shortcuts do not work on a macc. If I acivate he numpad in my setings though, then the mac numbers at the top, work as the numbers at window\u2019s right. It is smart to learn the shortcuts as this is the way that Blender works best and most precise. Especially if you wanna scale or modify the object it is suggested to use the keyboard and not the mouse/ trackpad! For that it is handy to check the manuals and check the one for the short-cut operations . In the end I have data, actions and interfaces. A cube is a specific amount of data. And there are interfaces (in terms of comments) that trigger actions but each operation needs to be linked to a set of data. Everyhings works a bit different (to simpel IOS interfaces) in Blender: I click to select and then I apply the action via a command. And then I confirm that action. This is all because the Blender-software was not designed to be sold, but designed to be used. Good job Victor, I love blender already - yet I am not sure how and where to use it because animation is really nt my thin and by now I have learned Rhino too well t switch my 3D moodelling software. live coding as a human interface \u00b6 26. april with Xavi Dom\u00ednguez aka er Lunni and Citlali Hern\u00e1ndez aka Turbulente we are working with a hackmd to follow back the references and handy links. Xavi introduces us first into the wide and complex world of what digtal/human interface entails and what it means to make data interact and translate into various forms. what language to use? This german collective collected all language for interefaces in which I can learn and understand. having experiences already IFTTT connects various services with each other. Thus for example can I gather data with certain sensors and arduino and then connect via IIFTTT to something like a map or google-sheet or other digital data interfaces. langchain is a python framework for interfaces (like text to speech) then, Citlali from Mexico presents us her work of live coding before we get to try things ourselves. As one example did Citlali created a second skin which she wore during a performance in which online webcam watchers could leave comments and likes which would be translated into senses that the second skiin would translate to her moving. Here, she used a Rasberry P and a text to speech tool to make the skin read her out loud some of the comment and feel likes via vibrations. so what is live coding? \u201cshow us your screens!\u201d The intention is to share the code all the time. It appeared n the DJ cene when seeing DJs live-mixing and sharing theiir screens for everyone to see what they are actually doing. There is a live coding community in Barclone Toplab , they have a agenda with all the events and are happy to share and exchange. Citlani uses live coding for visuals, images not for audio, music. In general, it allows you to improvise and play around with the codes. Another interesting live coding group is a womens collective that also plays in hangar . People are creating new languages (such as hydra by olivia) a lot and the community grows a lot. If you want to train smethinng to undnerstand your new language , you can use ssoftwares such as wekinator . we are testing hydra which is a simple and easy-to-understand coding language. This language is a live coding video synthesiser. It is created with javascript, which is my it is workinig directly in my browser. Live so to say. As soon as I change something in the code, the backgground visuals are changing as well. Tip: change some numbers in the code and in order to \u201cupload\u201d, in order to activate the change in the parameter I click option+enter or the play-icon in the upper corner. for knowing some generator-codings, she is sharing her documnt , a cheatsheet for shapes and other options. If I want to install hydra on my computer and experiment with sound and visuals, camera and microphones there, in the github there is everything documented of how to install and experiment with it. blender 2.0 now as interface \u00b6 27. april with Victor when we write code, we write instruction that are being written from left to right and from up to down. This is changing, when you want things to happen parallel, simultaniously and in relation to each other. This is when we talk abut objects. Python is a language for such objects. Each object has a set of properties and methods. We create classes and instances for these objects. In python we have the main object that entails ALL possible operations = bpy.ops.mesh . In this object, all operatoins, actions that blender is capable of, are being shown. Python comes with a standard list of default options. (words that are fuctions; e.g. range()). ok we play with mesh-monkey Suzanne and try out all the complexities. For that, we follow the code that are available in the hackmd . ok next step. We try to use all the potential of python (victor really recommends to spend a few afternoons on python tutorials because this language is just beautiful and very handy). We want to now connect our phones to ur blender and start rotating ur suzanne-monkey by moving our phone. So for that we need to download an application that allows us to record with the sensors of our phones and send them via wifi to our python. To experiment with the sensorss no my phone I can play with phyphox and try reading and vizualizing the recordings of the sensors of the phone. It is unfortunately not useful for today because it only allows us to access our sensor-data - not to push them via wifi onto the network from which we could access the data in python. we want to write a script that is monitoring our phone (sensors) and sents them in real time to a network. bueno. It seems apple does not make it easy for us to access the sensors. We cannot easily find an applcation so we are followinig together on Victors android phone and the projection of the coding. the code for making suzanne rotating by rotating the (andrid)phone. Important is to change the host and prt accrdingly. import bpy import socket # Setup UDP socket host = '192.168.0.12' # The same address of your computer port = 5555 s = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM) s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_REUSEADDR, 1) s.setsockopt(socket.SOL_SOCKET, socket.SO_BROADCAST, 1) s.bind((host, port)) s.settimeout(1) # Receive data try: message, address = self.s.recvfrom(8192) # Check if the data is complete (sometimes the app sends only some of the sensors) if len(message.split(b',')) == 17: x = float(message.split(b',')[-2]) * 0.01745 y = float(message.split(b',')[-1]) * 0.01745 z = float(message.split(b',')[-3]) * 0.01745 # print(x,y,z) context.object.rotation_euler.x = x context.object.rotation_euler.y = y context.object.rotation_euler.z = z except: # Stop if no more data is received self.cancel(context) return {'CANCELLED'} def execute(self, context): wm = context.window_manager self._timer = wm.event_timer_add(0.001, window=context.window) wm.modal_handler_add(self) return {'RUNNING_MODAL'} Now just run the script and if everything is Ok you will see Suzanne rotating! so with this code we made uor monkey in blender move (rotate) when we moved (rotated) victors phone. We can also uses arduino to trigger object-movement in blender. therefore we need the arduino code. Well, I ask ChatGPT to write me a code to make all my LED (60 on my strip) light up one after another in the color green. #include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h> #define PIN 12 #define NUMPIXELS 60 Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800); int value = 0; void setup() { Serial.begin(115200); pixels.begin(); } void loop() { if (Serial.available()) value = Serial.parseInt(); while (Serial.available()) Serial.read(); for(int i=0; i<NUMPIXELS; i++) { if (i == value) { pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0, 250, 0)); } else if (abs(i - value) == 1) { pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0,15, 0)); } else if (abs(i - value) == 2) { pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0, 1, 0)); } else { pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0, 0, 0)); } pixels.show(); } delay(20); } works, perfect. Thus now, I copy the code from victor to make it work with our blender file and upload also his blender file. #include <Adafruit_NeoPixel.h> #define PIN 12 #define NUMPIXELS 20 Adafruit_NeoPixel pixels(NUMPIXELS, PIN, NEO_GRB + NEO_KHZ800); int value = 0; void setup() { Serial.begin(115200); pixels.begin(); } void loop() { if (Serial.available()) value = Serial.parseInt(); while (Serial.available()) Serial.read(); for(int i=0; i<NUMPIXELS; i++) { if (i == value) { pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0, 250, 0)); } else if (abs(i - value) == 1) { pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0,15, 0)); } else if (abs(i - value) == 2) { pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0, 1, 0)); } else { pixels.setPixelColor(i, pixels.Color(0, 0, 0)); } pixels.show(); } delay(20); } now, the blender-file already has victors script.

So therefore the digital tool can be a guidance and interesting inpiraton to change the process of your work. e.g. if an image-tool has 100 filters, you will try out various options which will make your work. Blender is a free and open source 3D creation suit that is often used for animation-making and movies. During this session Victor (once again) brought us closer to the complex interrelationships of business, the open-soource world and the user and their creations. He summarized how the tools we choose force us towards determined paths - and that good and open-source softwares should allow us to determine and explore by ourself if we put the time and effort to grasp them. We are thus dependant on that which is available to us within these choices. A bit of history before we get to know how to use blender. decisions! we depend on the choices the software allows us to make. ARE WE? if we are designers and want to call us as such, we should know the software we use till the point that we can modify and use it with freedom and creativty. Otherwise, we are just \u201ctechhnical operaters\u201d of a system that makes you. About blender: In 1994 the first source file was written. This wass the inspiration for the in 2002 creation of \u201cBlender\u201d. Ton Roosendaal was one of the founders and his keynote speach is exceptionally interesting (according to Victor - fanboy ). Blender is a open sourcec software - meaning, there are rules of how to use, modify and distribute source files according to the standards of the open source concept . The open source initiative does make the rules and gives out licenses. Thus as a free alie (if I download the source file and I modify and distribut it) has to apply to the rule and publish the modified verssions under the same conitions. Because it is opensource, all money generated with the software, is being distributed to of people and not centralized and concentrated in one company. The question the remains how to design a profitable bussinesss-moodel for such a platform? Blender has a movie concept in which they collaborate with visual artists to release (cinema) movies with which they earn money. How to work with blender. the user-interface of blender is a bit strage because it is not built to SELL the software but to work on things together. The user-interface thus is a bit more complicated. this tool is not to make to learn-by-doing in an intuitive way. If considering using blender seriously, I will need to read the extensive manuals available. As an example, in blender everyone can create their own \u201ctool-board\u201d, their own windows that will be designed according to each projects need. Blender has a mode-editer, which means I can be in different modes in order to apply a different sets of operations to the data. That helps to transform any data into animations. Another important thing when working with blender on mac is to enable the numpad. Because windows has a number-pad on the right side, the shortcuts do not work on a macc. If I acivate he numpad in my setings though, then the mac numbers at the top, work as the numbers at window\u2019s right. It is smart to learn the shortcuts as this is the way that Blender works best and most precise. Especially if you wanna scale or modify the object it is suggested to use the keyboard and not the mouse/ trackpad! For that it is handy to check the manuals and check the one for the short-cut operations . In the end I have data, actions and interfaces. A cube is a specific amount of data. And there are interfaces (in terms of comments) that trigger actions but each operation needs to be linked to a set of data. Everyhings works a bit different (to simpel IOS interfaces) in Blender: I click to select and then I apply the action via a command. And then I confirm that action. This is all because the Blender-software was not designed to be sold, but designed to be used. Good job Victor, I love blender already - yet I am not sure how and where to use it because animation is really nt my thin and by now I have learned Rhino too well t switch my 3D moodelling software.","title":"blender"},{"location":"term3/prototyping/notes/#live-coding-as-a-human-interface","text":"26. april with Xavi Dom\u00ednguez aka er Lunni and Citlali Hern\u00e1ndez aka Turbulente we are working with a hackmd to follow back the references and handy links. Xavi introduces us first into the wide and complex world of what digtal/human interface entails and what it means to make data interact and translate into various forms. what language to use? This german collective collected all language for interefaces in which I can learn and understand. having experiences already IFTTT connects various services with each other. Thus for example can I gather data with certain sensors and arduino and then connect via IIFTTT to something like a map or google-sheet or other digital data interfaces. langchain is a python framework for interfaces (like text to speech) then, Citlali from Mexico presents us her work of live coding before we get to try things ourselves. As one example did Citlali created a second skin which she wore during a performance in which online webcam watchers could leave comments and likes which would be translated into senses that the second skiin would translate to her moving. Here, she used a Rasberry P and a text to speech tool to make the skin read her out loud some of the comment and feel likes via vibrations. so what is live coding? \u201cshow us your screens!\u201d The intention is to share the code all the time. It appeared n the DJ cene when seeing DJs live-mixing and sharing theiir screens for everyone to see what they are actually doing. There is a live coding community in Barclone Toplab , they have a agenda with all the events and are happy to share and exchange. Citlani uses live coding for visuals, images not for audio, music. In general, it allows you to improvise and play around with the codes. Another interesting live coding group is a womens collective that also plays in hangar . People are creating new languages (such as hydra by olivia) a lot and the community grows a lot. If you want to train smethinng to undnerstand your new language , you can use ssoftwares such as wekinator . we are testing hydra which is a simple and easy-to-understand coding language. This language is a live coding video synthesiser. It is created with javascript, which is my it is workinig directly in my browser. Live so to say. As soon as I change something in the code, the backgground visuals are changing as well. Tip: change some numbers in the code and in order to \u201cupload\u201d, in order to activate the change in the parameter I click option+enter or the play-icon in the upper corner. for knowing some generator-codings, she is sharing her documnt , a cheatsheet for shapes and other options.

This is changing, when you want things to happen parallel, simultaniously and in relation to each other. This is when we talk abut objects. Python is a language for such objects. Each object has a set of properties and methods. We create classes and instances for these objects. In python we have the main object that entails ALL possible operations = bpy.ops.mesh . In this object, all operatoins, actions that blender is capable of, are being shown. Python comes with a standard list of default options. (words that are fuctions; e.g. range()). ok we play with mesh-monkey Suzanne and try out all the complexities. For that, we follow the code that are available in the hackmd . ok next step. We try to use all the potential of python (victor really recommends to spend a few afternoons on python tutorials because this language is just beautiful and very handy). We want to now connect our phones to ur blender and start rotating ur suzanne-monkey by moving our phone. So for that we need to download an application that allows us to record with the sensors of our phones and send them via wifi to our python. To experiment with the sensorss no my phone I can play with phyphox and try reading and vizualizing the recordings of the sensors of the phone. It is unfortunately not useful for today because it only allows us to access our sensor-data - not to push them via wifi onto the network from which we could access the data in python. we want to write a script that is monitoring our phone (sensors) and sents them in real time to a network. bueno. It seems apple does not make it easy for us to access the sensors. We cannot easily find an applcation so we are followinig together on Victors android phone and the projection of the coding. the code for making suzanne rotating by rotating the (andrid)phone.

Not a fixes category (like the proletariat ). If we manage to change the structure during our lifes, maybe we manage to not be subalterns when we die. there is nothing more authoritarian than giving voice to others or collecive. Because these people HAVE already voices. Her approach is to critically analyse the (infra)structures that denied these voices to speak up in the first place. What happens with the so-called subalterns is that they are subjects whose dialectical condition is not recognized and is then silenced for centuries. How many structures are workiing here in order to deny these voices? what has been happening with representations? @Audrey Lorde \u201cWe cant demolish the masterhouse with the master tools.\u201d The subaltern cant leave their condition of their subalternatiy using the tools of the hegemonic colonial structures.

Lauer is giving this class, whereas she should not be the one.

He is a great reader of Edward Said. She is raising a question as a critical trigger because she knows, she is convinced that the subaltern is no a fixes persona but is actually in making - it is a relational conditions. Not a fixes category (like the proletariat ). If we manage to change the structure during our lifes, maybe we manage to not be subalterns when we die. there is nothing more authoritarian than giving voice to others or collecive. Because these people HAVE already voices. Her approach is to critically analyse the (infra)structures that denied these voices to speak up in the first place. What happens with the so-called subalterns is that they are subjects whose dialectical condition is not recognized and is then silenced for centuries. How many structures are workiing here in order to deny these voices? what has been happening with representations? @Audrey Lorde \u201cWe cant demolish the masterhouse with the master tools.\u201d The subaltern cant leave their condition of their subalternatiy using the tools of the hegemonic colonial structures.

Lauer is giving this class, whereas she should not be the one.

There were 25 of us on El Hierro and we all stayed together in a very cute resort with different flats. I was with four friends (multi-international: Myrto (Greek), Mari (Brazilian), Korbi (Swiss), Clodi (Italian)) in one, there was a pool and some avocado trees, also some mango trees but I was too early for that, and we lived next to a pineapple field. During the day we drove all over the island (we had rented 6 cars with which we always drove in caravan style through the prairie) and looked at all kinds of things, the organic farms, the beehives, the banana plantations, the water treatment centres, the wind turbines and their energy centres, the volcano remains which are now almost walk-in caves. We have seen so much different nature\u2026 the pine forests that have developed a special kind of pine here - which are heat resistant and live on even after a forest fire, but die below 0 degrees, wet forests in the mountains where the clouds are always hanging and therefore all the trees have grown moss like beards, the cooled lava fields that look like extraterrestrial terrains - desert with black rocks and boulders and streams that look like they want to keep flowing, here only a few short cacti grow that stick out of the black like miniature trees. The natural swimming pools in which you can swim, again made of lava (or rock?) - we hacked into the rock by the sea, there are simply large pools into which the big waves slosh with a little less force and hold the water. Here you can snorkel beautifully and watch trumpet fish and turtles and I know how many other small colourful fish. Once we also found a beach, at sunset we went to the very tip of the island, where there is only an old lighthouse that has not been in use for a long time. And there was a beach with red sand and a great surf. We sat on the big round stones until the sun was all the way in Brazil and then quickly waded through the coming tide back to the jetty towards the car. A few days later, Javier (our local tour guide of the island - the best person I\u2019ve met in a long time) told us over dinner at the top of the mountain, with a view over the clouds and after a while all the stars of the universe, about lentejas and queues curada and asparagus and lots of mojo on everything, that this beach is not natural but that some time ago people had worked in the rocks above it. These rocks above our little beach were a certain part of a solidified volcano that runs into the mountain like a ring (huge ring, horizontal and several kilometres in diameter) and whose rock is reddish-brown and very porous. Well, work was done here and the rock was loosened and eroded and rolled down to the sea and collected there. They thought that the current and everything would take care of it, but no, until today there is still this small red sandy beach, which is actually neither sand nor beach. On the eighth day, I took the ferry with Clodi and Mari and we chugged to Tenerife. The sea was pretty wild. I had somehow forgotten that I\u2019m not so good at driving. For the first hour and a half I puked my guts out and noticed nothing but the toilet and the swaying windows. Well, we survived that too, and then we were on Tenerife and had a campervan, with fridge and bed, and drove it down (what felt like) every road on Tenerife. We went to Teide National Park, a new desert where they actually have a scientific observatory for the universe and an institute that does sampling in the area to test prototype equipment for Mars, Venus and lunar excursions. Because the soil and the climatic conditions here at the 3000 metres above the earthly sea level are probably similar to the conditions we assume on these other planets. And we went to Masca, a tiny village (actually just a few little houses) high up in a very steep narrow valley. Super green and colourful with all the pink-purple flowers and wild bananas and palms and papayas (papayas, by the way, were our daily breakfast and I miss it extremely already). Of course, we also saw the ugly sides of Tenerife (hard to miss, unfortunately). Once it was late and we were looking for a place to sleep at Los Gigantes and found a parking space on the coast in this crazy ugly, inhuman hotel accumulation. After consuming our wine and tomatoes on the rocks by the water (climbed over the fence to escape the asphalt and plastic white ugliness) we walked around the place, I was really so shocked, the only positive was a drag show where an artist changed from woman to man several times during his performance. But really abstruse that night. On the way back to our car we had to get a bottle of wine and chocolate. In the morning we packed up as quickly as we could and set off, this time to another national park in the north. As long as you don\u2019t meet any houses or people in Tenerife (except for those from the island itself, who are really all quite heart-warming), it\u2019s wonderfully beautiful (of course, nowhere near as beautiful as La Gomera or El Hierro pero bueno). On the last evening we had a farewell dinner in La Laguna, papas arrugadas with lots of mojo, tomato salad because they don\u2019t taste good in Barcelona either, and the best dessert in the world, polvito uruguayo. And while we are sitting there in this cute little restaurant, with the green checked paper tablecloths, with salty hair from the sea and our bikinis still under our clothes, sipping wine and talking about everything and nothing, not only does a huge parade with a statue of Maria and cuckoo clan-like figures go by (semana santa, very catholic here and it will be Easter Monday in a few days) but it also suddenly starts to rain and after a while to hail and it gets freezing cold. Totally absurd, but a clear sign for us that it is time to leave the island.
