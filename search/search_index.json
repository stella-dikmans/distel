I am a fan of differences; I don\u2019t believe with homogeneity we will get anywhere. yet there is a clear distinction between difference and inequality. that the effects of climate change lead to threat and death of some human and non-human organisms, and to prosperity and luxury to others is not difference but the result of inequal distribution of resource-access and -consumption, knowledge-acquisition and -production, available adaptation- and coping-mechanisms, -strategies, -tools and so on. I am convinced that there are enough resources (human-brains that think, potent materials to be used responsibly, already developed, and tested mechanisms and strategies that will function as tools\u2026) to prevent the effects of climate change leading to death of any human and non-human organisms. but instead of using the power that some have (because of access to these resources) to establish equally safe and thriving places everywhere, the effects of climate change are becoming more extreme. why is that so ? I was educated as a sociologist and an artist; I don\u2019t dare to give an answer that would suffice the complexity of human behavior. but there are two ways I can approach the question: firstly, through what I experience myself: when things are unknown, they seem to be more difficult to the extent that we often ignore them. what we don\u2019t know, seems vast and impossible to access. what we do know becomes familiar and easy to handle. one example: getting to know your ways. in a new city, we figure out one way to get to the metro when we arrive. we will use that way from now on. there are thousands of ways to get to the station, yet we are likely to stick to the one we know. because it feels the fastest to us. if we tried another way, we would experience it as longer, even though it might technically be shorter. that is because our brains like to know/ have experienced things, and it is easily overwhelmed by things we do not know/ have not experienced. similarly, we face climate change. we easily ignore what we have not experienced and cling to the ways and techniques we have experienced. in an individualist, capitalist world like the one I was raised and socialized in, this has fatal consequences. secondly, I can approach the question through the thoughts of previous thinkers. according to Zygmunt Bauman, power is the ability to have things done and politics is the ability to decide which things are to be done. his analysis of contemporaneity conclude that whereas earlier the abilities of power and politics were united in one place (nation-state government), nowadays, power has evaporated into global cyber-worlds while politics remained on local, nation-state levels. politics therefor failed to emigrate into the space of flows that Manuel Castells describes as the digital turn allowing distant synchronous, real-time interactions. following this line of theory, the major source of contemporary fear is that no one is in control \u2013 which can be translated into a fear of the unknown. we are thus faced with a growing gap between the ability to do things and ability to decide, coerce the power of agencies to do what needs to be done because we are scared to experience the vastness of the unknown. although I am convinced that the overall goal should be to train our brains to become comfortable with the unknown in general, the more immediate result will come from making vastness less big. switching what Bauman has analyzed, establishing global politics and local power. my practice aims to make climate change affects \u2018small\u2019 and handleable on a global scale by making them known. getting comfortable with the thought of not having a somewhere else to throw shit at; to create awareness that its all the same place; that there is only here, only this world with all its differences and human and non-human organisms that are equally worth protecting and thriving. in the end this has something to do with the notion of relevance. relevance as subjective and relative, determined by its space-time conditions. what do we learn to know and what do we not?

Oscar Tomico introduced us to four different roles that prototyping can play in design practice and enquiry processes. (1) prototype serves as an experimental component: here a hypothesis is tested (2) prototype serves as a means of inquiry: here an open-minded exploration is performed and the pt is the instrument (3) prototype serves as a research archetype: here the pt serves as an illustration and demonstration to show possible results of the research (4) prototype serves as a directing tool for inquiry: here the making-process (with all involved agents) of the pt is helping to direct the research fast scaling and fast failing are important to the design practice as this is what helps to understand the granularity of situational contexts in which a design intervention is thought to have impact. personal experience with these four roles of prototyping \u00b6 a prototype\u2019s role as a hypothesis tester is in my experience common in scientific and architectural research. at least in social research, we often make up hypothesis and then go on quantitative or qualitative investigations trying to falsify our assumptions. also in architectural design processes, I experienced the theoretical anticipation of certain scenarios and a subsequent practical approach of making small-scale models to test whether the ideas were accurate. for my project on unequal access to water (in terms of quantity and quality) I would like to investigate without prior assumptions. but I can imagine that at certain moments it makes sense to focus on a particular hypothesis and its application. this will help to concentrate the research area. as a mean of inquiry, prototypes were essential to my bachelor-thesis that dealt with the influence of one\u2019s social surrounding on one\u2019s environmental attitude. the qualitative interviews I conducted had a clear guideline, which I adapted depending on the recipient and the situation. I conducted each interview only once and weaved the obtained data into my observations. another social research I implemented was a quantitative survey on the housing situation among art students in Amsterdam. the survey was my tool to obtain the data I was looking for. in both cases, the topic was clear yet there was no outcome assumed. to find out how water is consumed by the inhabitants of Barcelona, I can use prototypes of water filters, water measures etc. to obtain relevant data within a framework yet without prior expectations. Furthermore, I can be the prototype myself to observe patterns in water consumption (regarding quantity and quality). as an archetypal prototype, I once wrote a fictional story about a future in which a virtual object provides the framework for a society that has sterilized themselves to the extent that Earth seems toxic in every sense. building on the data I have received from myself as a prototype, I can also use myself as an archetypal prototype: I can determine the access and the amount of water I have; I can embody what access and consumption looks like in different areas and situational contexts (in Barcelona and beyond), etc.. the last role of prototypes, the one where prototypes serve as vehicles for enquiry, is one that I have probably unconsciously explored a lot. here, the research itself directs the area of exploration. I\u2019m thinking of building fires in nature, cooking when the fridge is empty, sharing beds when there are more people than pillows to sleep on.... here it is the process of making, looking for dry wood under bushes, mixing garlic and honey to make spice, stacking clothes to soften the ground.... All these things lead to observations, to insights that one would never have gained by defining an area of research or asking a question beforehand. the information and interest come while doing, while prototyping ideas. I think that this role also is the most interesting to my still very wide and open project. inequalities regarding water access is widely investigated theoretically and explored in many ways through practical interventions.

(1) prototype serves as an experimental component: here a hypothesis is tested (2) prototype serves as a means of inquiry: here an open-minded exploration is performed and the pt is the instrument (3) prototype serves as a research archetype: here the pt serves as an illustration and demonstration to show possible results of the research (4) prototype serves as a directing tool for inquiry: here the making-process (with all involved agents) of the pt is helping to direct the research fast scaling and fast failing are important to the design practice as this is what helps to understand the granularity of situational contexts in which a design intervention is thought to have impact.","title":"prototyping"},{"location":"designstudio/prototyping/prototyping/#personal-experience-with-these-four-roles-of-prototyping","text":"a prototype\u2019s role as a hypothesis tester is in my experience common in scientific and architectural research. at least in social research, we often make up hypothesis and then go on quantitative or qualitative investigations trying to falsify our assumptions. also in architectural design processes, I experienced the theoretical anticipation of certain scenarios and a subsequent practical approach of making small-scale models to test whether the ideas were accurate. for my project on unequal access to water (in terms of quantity and quality) I would like to investigate without prior assumptions. but I can imagine that at certain moments it makes sense to focus on a particular hypothesis and its application. this will help to concentrate the research area. as a mean of inquiry, prototypes were essential to my bachelor-thesis that dealt with the influence of one\u2019s social surrounding on one\u2019s environmental attitude. the qualitative interviews I conducted had a clear guideline, which I adapted depending on the recipient and the situation. I conducted each interview only once and weaved the obtained data into my observations. another social research I implemented was a quantitative survey on the housing situation among art students in Amsterdam. the survey was my tool to obtain the data I was looking for. in both cases, the topic was clear yet there was no outcome assumed. to find out how water is consumed by the inhabitants of Barcelona, I can use prototypes of water filters, water measures etc. to obtain relevant data within a framework yet without prior expectations. Furthermore, I can be the prototype myself to observe patterns in water consumption (regarding quantity and quality). as an archetypal prototype, I once wrote a fictional story about a future in which a virtual object provides the framework for a society that has sterilized themselves to the extent that Earth seems toxic in every sense. building on the data I have received from myself as a prototype, I can also use myself as an archetypal prototype: I can determine the access and the amount of water I have; I can embody what access and consumption looks like in different areas and situational contexts (in Barcelona and beyond), etc.. the last role of prototypes, the one where prototypes serve as vehicles for enquiry, is one that I have probably unconsciously explored a lot. here, the research itself directs the area of exploration. I\u2019m thinking of building fires in nature, cooking when the fridge is empty, sharing beds when there are more people than pillows to sleep on.... here it is the process of making, looking for dry wood under bushes, mixing garlic and honey to make spice, stacking clothes to soften the ground.... All these things lead to observations, to insights that one would never have gained by defining an area of research or asking a question beforehand. the information and interest come while doing, while prototyping ideas. I think that this role also is the most interesting to my still very wide and open project. inequalities regarding water access is widely investigated theoretically and explored in many ways through practical interventions. I would like to explore openly and through a collaborative process with people and more-than-human beings what water means, to me, to others, to structures of inequality.","title":"personal experience with these four roles of prototyping"},{"location":"term1/aows/aows/","text":"atlas of weak signals \u00b6 design space of weak signals \u00b6 looking closely. imagining widely. weak signals are indicators to identify a change in the future with little or no impact on the present, but with the potential to lead to the identification of major impact events. they set trends and indicate certain directions and by that draw up future scenarios. investigating weak signals enables a practical approach to navigate and understand possible emerging scenarios. it facilitates seeking opportunities, threats, challenges and shared visions for innovation, policymaking, intervention, research, and business opportunities in the future. the atlas itself is a card set, a toolkit designed by Mariana Quintero. it provides a structure to design a \u201cspace\u201d to move and position oneself in. it considers the complex panorama of our present as well as future challenges and helps to disclose and create opportunities for design interventions. personal weak signals and subsequent design space \u00b6 my weak signals are: \u201cfight Anthropocene conflicts\u201d, \u201ctechnology for equality\u201d, and \u201cinter-species collaboration\u201d. my areas of opportunity are: \u201cmulti-scalar thinking\u201d, \u201cenvironmental sensing\u201d, \u201cco-creation\u201d. additionally, I included \u201cnarrative creation\u201d, \u201cenvironmental health\u201d, and \u201cuniversal rights\u201d into my most important set of terms. for my high school finals in 2016, I wrote a piece on the potential of the concept and term \u201cAnthropocene\u201d to bring climate change and environmental health to the center of social and political discourses. this was shortly before a 34-member team at the 35 th International Geological Congress in Cape Town confirmed the theses on anthropological impacts and its own valid terminology. in 2020, I dealt with the effects of the social environment on one\u2019s own environmental attitude in my sociology bachelor\u2019s thesis, again investigating with the human being in focus. only at art college, I started to incorporate my more-than-human interests into my professional practice.
