Mollusk and fish corpses washed up on the shores and floated on the water surface of the 840km long river. Scientist from various institutions took water probes and discussed possible causes but it seemed difficult to identify and contextualize what had happened. By the end of September, it seemed agreed upon that the sudden death resulted from a toxin-producing microalga that would kill the life of the river for the coming years. However, the thriving of this algae has multiple causes. A poor water quality due to uncommon high temperatures and a very low water levels encouraged the golden algae (Prymnesium parvum), which was identified by the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in all water samples, to flourish (4, 3, 5). This causes high levels of salinity (1, 4, 5) till the point fish and mollusk organisms could not survive. It is assumed that this large overgrowth of toxic algae is next to the result of the environmental change, linked to industrial pollution, chemical wastes that was dumped into the water at some point of the river and continued to spread with its flow (1, 3, 2, 4, 5). The chemical pollutant could not be identified because the investigations started to late (4, 5). In the field of science, they talk about a failure of governmental communication and collaboration (2, 4, 5). Water samples were sent to laboratories in different countries to help identifying the cause (5). What seems clear to all institutions is that the life in the Oder-river has been disrupted and that it will take years for fishes and mollusks to come back to its banks. But why is the research focus so limited to the restoration of a former state of nature? How is it that, although it is agreed that nature is constantly evolving and adapting, so little research is done on the potential of the newly introduced microorganisms that populate the river from now on? The Oder-river comes from the Czech Republic, passes through Poland and Germany and continues their border till it flows into the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s a flowing water that does not stop neither change its qualities according to the made-up lines nation-states draw upon it. Yet the responsibility over the quality of the water is divided to different authorities which causes an inability to response, the lack of response-ability for environmental conditions like this. Environmental scientist James Lovelock criticized the growing disinterest in global phenomena and interdependencies in biology, where he felt it was so necessary to. Instead of focusing on molecular biology and genetic evolution, the small picture of biology research, scientist should return to seeing the big picture and start contextualizing biological phenomena (6). For Lovelock, the study of life had to be holistic; scientist should approach life as one whole organism rather focusing exclusively on the examinations of molecules and atoms (6). This would open our eyes to the self-regulating forces and feedback-systems of nature and how we can adapt our actions and sciences to them. What is happening in the examination of the Oder-river this summer is an example of science breaking wholeness into pieces and trying to restore a previous environmental state. Yet if there would be a non-human centric approach to the situation, scientist could start looking for collaboration with the more-than-human organisms inhabiting the Oder-river. There is agreement that changing climatic conditions in terms of a warmer atmosphere have also led to the appearance of golden algae. The greenhouse gas effect that helps warming up the Earth is being intensively researched, and one of its solutions is seen in algal growth. In 2007, Lovelock presented a technical proposal to stimulate algal growth, \u201cto draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds that would decrease global heating\u201c(7). Prymnesium parvum has been known since 1985 and its lethal potential has been extensively studied. Using morphological studies and genome sequencing, scientists are finding out about its potential to form and spread viruses. Similar techniques can be used to determine the potential for carbon sequestration and the algae\u2019s purpose in its wider context of a global climatological changes. As a microalga, it \u201cassimilates CO2 during autotrophic growth and produces biomass for various applications, including bioenergy production\u201d(8). The dispute between Poland and Germany about the responsibility of the Oder-disaster, shows how, like the division of land into countries, science\u2019s approach to study specifies, sometimes fails to integrate particular events into wider interdependent phenomena. Instead of blaming each other and trying to find the cause of this environmental disaster in a particular chemical pollutant released by a particular institution or person, scientists could focus on the potential collaboration with this emerging organism and see how the Oder-river could be a potential tool for carbon sequestration and rebalancing the Earth\u2019s biosphere. sources: news reports: (1) https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/8/14/photos-germany-poland-mystery-surrounds-mass-fish-deaths-in-the-oder-river (2) https://phys.org/news/2022-09-germany-mass-fish-deaths-oder.html (3) https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rare-toxic-algae-behind-fish-deaths-river-oder-say-researchers-2022-08-19/ (4) https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62688036 (5) https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/rare-golden-algae-may-have-caused-fish-deaths-in-oder-river-says-minister scientific backing: (6) James E.

A poor water quality due to uncommon high temperatures and a very low water levels encouraged the golden algae (Prymnesium parvum), which was identified by the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in all water samples, to flourish (4, 3, 5). This causes high levels of salinity (1, 4, 5) till the point fish and mollusk organisms could not survive. It is assumed that this large overgrowth of toxic algae is next to the result of the environmental change, linked to industrial pollution, chemical wastes that was dumped into the water at some point of the river and continued to spread with its flow (1, 3, 2, 4, 5). The chemical pollutant could not be identified because the investigations started to late (4, 5). In the field of science, they talk about a failure of governmental communication and collaboration (2, 4, 5). Water samples were sent to laboratories in different countries to help identifying the cause (5). What seems clear to all institutions is that the life in the Oder-river has been disrupted and that it will take years for fishes and mollusks to come back to its banks. But why is the research focus so limited to the restoration of a former state of nature? How is it that, although it is agreed that nature is constantly evolving and adapting, so little research is done on the potential of the newly introduced microorganisms that populate the river from now on? The Oder-river comes from the Czech Republic, passes through Poland and Germany and continues their border till it flows into the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s a flowing water that does not stop neither change its qualities according to the made-up lines nation-states draw upon it. Yet the responsibility over the quality of the water is divided to different authorities which causes an inability to response, the lack of response-ability for environmental conditions like this. Environmental scientist James Lovelock criticized the growing disinterest in global phenomena and interdependencies in biology, where he felt it was so necessary to. Instead of focusing on molecular biology and genetic evolution, the small picture of biology research, scientist should return to seeing the big picture and start contextualizing biological phenomena (6). For Lovelock, the study of life had to be holistic; scientist should approach life as one whole organism rather focusing exclusively on the examinations of molecules and atoms (6). This would open our eyes to the self-regulating forces and feedback-systems of nature and how we can adapt our actions and sciences to them. What is happening in the examination of the Oder-river this summer is an example of science breaking wholeness into pieces and trying to restore a previous environmental state. Yet if there would be a non-human centric approach to the situation, scientist could start looking for collaboration with the more-than-human organisms inhabiting the Oder-river. There is agreement that changing climatic conditions in terms of a warmer atmosphere have also led to the appearance of golden algae. The greenhouse gas effect that helps warming up the Earth is being intensively researched, and one of its solutions is seen in algal growth. In 2007, Lovelock presented a technical proposal to stimulate algal growth, \u201cto draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds that would decrease global heating\u201c(7). Prymnesium parvum has been known since 1985 and its lethal potential has been extensively studied. Using morphological studies and genome sequencing, scientists are finding out about its potential to form and spread viruses. Similar techniques can be used to determine the potential for carbon sequestration and the algae\u2019s purpose in its wider context of a global climatological changes. As a microalga, it \u201cassimilates CO2 during autotrophic growth and produces biomass for various applications, including bioenergy production\u201d(8). The dispute between Poland and Germany about the responsibility of the Oder-disaster, shows how, like the division of land into countries, science\u2019s approach to study specifies, sometimes fails to integrate particular events into wider interdependent phenomena. Instead of blaming each other and trying to find the cause of this environmental disaster in a particular chemical pollutant released by a particular institution or person, scientists could focus on the potential collaboration with this emerging organism and see how the Oder-river could be a potential tool for carbon sequestration and rebalancing the Earth\u2019s biosphere. sources: news reports: (1)https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/8/14/photos-germany-poland-mystery-surrounds-mass-fish-deaths-in-the-oder-river (2) https://phys.org/news/2022-09-germany-mass-fish-deaths-oder.html (3) https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rare-toxic-algae-behind-fish-deaths-river-oder-say-researchers-2022-08-19/ (4) https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62688036 (5) https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/rare-golden-algae-may-have-caused-fish-deaths-in-oder-river-says-minister scientific backing: (6) James E.

I am a fan of differences; I don\u2019t believe with homogeneity we will get anywhere. yet there is a clear distinction between difference and inequality. that the effects of climate change lead to threat and death of some human and non-human organisms, and to prosperity and luxury to others is not difference but the result of inequal distribution of resource-access and -consumption, knowledge-acquisition and -production, available adaptation- and coping-mechanisms, -strategies, -tools, and so on. I am convinced that there are enough resources (human-brains that think, potent materials to be used responsibly, already developed, and tested mechanisms and strategies that will function as tools\u2026) to prevent the effects of climate change leading to death of any human and non-human organisms. but instead of using the power that some have (because of access to these resources) to establish equally safe and thriving places everywhere, the effects of climate change are becoming more extreme. why is that so ? I was educated as a sociologist and an artist; I cannot give an answer that would suffice the complexity of human behavior. but there are two ways I can approach the question: firstly, through what I experience myself: when things are unknown, they seem to be more difficult to the extent that we often ignore them. what we don\u2019t know, seems vast and impossible to access. similarly, we treat climate change. we easily ignore what we have not experienced or what is out of our immediate reach and cling to the ways and techniques we have experienced ourselves in our immediate environments. in a disconnected, individualist, capitalist world like the one I was raised and socialized in, this has fatal consequences. the knowledge of only two generations before us gets lost because we ourselves have not experienced its benefits; new technologies have freed us from thinking further than our own lives, the next year, the people living 15 km away, or even in the next street. we barely can emphasize with more than what we can touch. this happens on various scales, on the personal as well as on the political. secondly, I can approach the question through the thoughts of previous thinkers. according to Zygmunt Bauman, power is the ability to have things done and politics is the ability to decide which things are to be done. his analysis of contemporaneity conclude that whereas earlier the abilities of power and politics were united in one place (nation-state government), nowadays, power has evaporated into global cyber-worlds while politics remained on local, nation-state levels. politics have failed to emigrate into the space of flows that Manuel Castells describes as the digital turn allowing distant synchronous, real-time interactions. power is today separated from politics and is in the hands of those who manage to navigate the systems of money and digital connectivity. it is in the hands of those who have the monopoly of telling stories that are listened to. following this line of theory, the major source of contemporary fear is that no one is in control and those in power just keep on telling their stories. to develop comprehensive and expansive responses to the impacts of global environmental changes, we must use and switch what Bauman has analyzed: establishing global politics and local power. that entails creating guidelines that open up unconditional spaces for a variety of stories to be told and heard; to allow the experience of the vastness of the unknown. my practice seeks for an equal distribution of the impacts of climate change and expansive responses to them by fueling the multiplicity of more-than-human narrations. I want to learn how to facilitate spaces for balanced relationships that embody synergies, acknowledging that the interconnected whole is made out of multiple parts. this is all the same place, one world with all its differences and human and non-human organisms that are equally worth protecting and thriving. in the end this has something to do with the notion of relevance. relevance as subjective and relative, determined by its space-time conditions. what do we learn to know and what do we not? what gets relevance to be known/ be experienced? giving relevance to the manifold relationships between human and non-human organisms can create awareness of our circular interdependencies and its unknown territories. influences: Anna Tsing, the mushroom at the end of the world https://www.academia.edu/40320405/The_Mushroom_at_the_End_of_the_World_Anna_Tsing (2015), https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8MhBwsKdJA (2021), ...

What did you make? And why did it matter? \u00b6 water is a renewable resource on a global scale but on a local scale one will experience the results of changing climatological conditions, the uneven concentration of the population, economic activities, and the restricted access to water. therefore, it can happen that even in an area that is water rich, water scarcity occurs. the availability of water depends not only on the quantity of water, but also on its quality: human activities (industry, fertilization, cosmetics\u2026) pollute the water, which must be treated in different stages. therefore, the effective net water decreases with each successive treatment cycle. in addition, the question of quality must consider its perspective. water that is treated to be healthy for humans can be toxic for other living beings, while the natural life present in untreated water can cause health problems in humans. in Barcelona, it rains 600l/m2 per year. but only one third of the city has permeable surfaces, two thirds are covered with asphalt, which means that the rainwater cannot enter the soil and the natural reservoirs below but evaporates or flows directly into the anthropocentric canal systems and their various treatment plants. there seems to be more water healthy to humans than healthy to other living organisms inhabiting the city. every day, 800 m2 of used and treated water, which in turn has been filtered to make it healthy for nature, flows back through the Canal de Bunyola into nature and into the sea, outside of the city. I wonder how urban environments are integrated into natural water cycles and envision a city where human water and natural water enrich each other. on average, a Barcelonian consumes 122 liter of water a day. this refers to water that has been collected from the rain and underground reservoirs and treated in various ways to make it accessible to humans, which means that it is \u201chealthy\u201d for humans to drink, but from nature\u2019s point of view it could be defined as dead or even poisoned. so, the question I ask is: which inhabitants have access to water in a city and for whom is this water \u201chealthy\u201d? further reflections \u00b6 What happens when you involve yourself? involving myself into this quest, I tried to live as a non-human inhabitant of Barcelona, drawing water exclusively from publicly accessible sources, without being able to cause the flow of water myself. I tried to be aware and conscious about with whom I am sharing these waters. What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? using myself as an instrument, I found that it is not easy to deviate from an anthropocentric perspective when living in a system, an environment, that is primarily designed for humans. my senses are not trained to recognize the need for water, let alone the techniques that non-human organisms use to get water. what I mainly observed were birds picking in the wet soil around the wells after humans had used the water and left traces. I also see the huge trees that are not set in tiles or asphalt, and flowering plants that are twice the size of the pots they are in. Did anything change about your way of working? I think that involving myself has led to more questions than answers, which is generally what I want from a research practice. therefore, the technique has enriched my practice and I am sure that I will benefit from it in many ways. I feel it helps to get out of a mode of active thinking and explore a practice-oriented approach towards asking questions when trying to observe an environment from a unknown perspective. What does it mean for your future work? I am not sure yet how and when I will integrate this technique into my current research.","title":"living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/livingwithyourownideas/autoethnographicintervention/#_1","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 5 / 1 - 5 November 2022","title":""},{"location":"term1/livingwithyourownideas/autoethnographicintervention/#living-with-your-own-ideas","text":"with Oscar Tomico, Kristina Andersen and Angella Mackey","title":"living with your own ideas"},{"location":"term1/livingwithyourownideas/autoethnographicintervention/#companionship","text":"","title":"companionship"},{"location":"term1/livingwithyourownideas/autoethnographicintervention/#my-companion-and-me","text":"learning from each other.","title":"my companion and me"},{"location":"term1/livingwithyourownideas/autoethnographicintervention/#autoethnographic-design-intervention","text":"embodying questions.","title":"autoethnographic design intervention"},{"location":"term1/livingwithyourownideas/autoethnographicintervention/#what-did-you-make-and-why-did-it-matter","text":"water is a renewable resource on a global scale but on a local scale one will experience the results of changing climatological conditions, the uneven concentration of the population, economic activities, and the restricted access to water. therefore, it can happen that even in an area that is water rich, water scarcity occurs. the availability of water depends not only on the quantity of water, but also on its quality: human activities (industry, fertilization, cosmetics\u2026) pollute the water, which must be treated in different stages. therefore, the effective net water decreases with each successive treatment cycle. in addition, the question of quality must consider its perspective. water that is treated to be healthy for humans can be toxic for other living beings, while the natural life present in untreated water can cause health problems in humans. in Barcelona, it rains 600l/m2 per year. but only one third of the city has permeable surfaces, two thirds are covered with asphalt, which means that the rainwater cannot enter the soil and the natural reservoirs below but evaporates or flows directly into the anthropocentric canal systems and their various treatment plants. there seems to be more water healthy to humans than healthy to other living organisms inhabiting the city. every day, 800 m2 of used and treated water, which in turn has been filtered to make it healthy for nature, flows back through the Canal de Bunyola into nature and into the sea, outside of the city.

What happens when you use yourself as an instrument? using myself as an instrument, I found that it is not easy to deviate from an anthropocentric perspective when living in a system, an environment, that is primarily designed for humans. my senses are not trained to recognize the need for water, let alone the techniques that non-human organisms use to get water. what I mainly observed were birds picking in the wet soil around the wells after humans had used the water and left traces. I also see the huge trees that are not set in tiles or asphalt, and flowering plants that are twice the size of the pots they are in. Did anything change about your way of working? I think that involving myself has led to more questions than answers, which is generally what I want from a research practice. therefore, the technique has enriched my practice and I am sure that I will benefit from it in many ways. I feel it helps to get out of a mode of active thinking and explore a practice-oriented approach towards asking questions when trying to observe an environment from a unknown perspective. What does it mean for your future work? I am not sure yet how and when I will integrate this technique into my current research.","title":"further reflections"},{"location":"term1/techbeyondthemyth/techbeyondthemyth/","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 6&7 / 9 - 19 November 2022 tech beyond the myth \u00b6 with Santi Fuentemilla, Eduardo Chamorro, Josep Mart\u00ed, Guillem Camprodon, \u00d3scar Gonz\u00e1lez and Victor Barber\u00e1n about transparentizing blackboxes \u00b6 undoing, unwrapping, unmythodologizing the blackboxes we live with.. we were spending these days from morning till late in the afternoon with this group of energetic, skilled and very patient men in IAAC to a point I come to actually like the idea of IAAC as a home (for the moment at least). never being left alone, Victor always took the time to sit and figure out some cable rewiring and celebrated each lightening LED with us. it were very practical days, of dealing with electronic-waste and redefining and remaking its functions into something valuable. we were tinkering about open-end experiences with electronics, we were experimenting with thought-worlds around inputs and outputs or reversed it all. we disintegrated systems and created new contexts for reintegration. the main aim of this course seemed to me to emancipate us from the dependence on monophonic narratives around technological devices.
