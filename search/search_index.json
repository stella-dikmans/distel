I also remember buying water to drink at the shop. as a very migraine-prone family, my mother always made sure that we didn\u2019t run out of drinking water. yet, for a family of four at 30 degrees in the shade, it was quite a few liters that we would consume in a day - that is, in a week.

Mollusk and fish corpses washed up on the shores and floated on the water surface of the 840km long river. Scientist from various institutions took water probes and discussed possible causes but it seemed difficult to identify and contextualize what had happened. By the end of September, it seemed agreed upon that the sudden death resulted from a toxin-producing microalga that would kill the life of the river for the coming years. However, the thriving of this algae has multiple causes. A poor water quality due to uncommon high temperatures and a very low water levels encouraged the golden algae (Prymnesium parvum), which was identified by the Leibniz Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) in all water samples, to flourish (4, 3, 5). This causes high levels of salinity (1, 4, 5) till the point fish and mollusk organisms could not survive. It is assumed that this large overgrowth of toxic algae is next to the result of the environmental change, linked to industrial pollution, chemical wastes that was dumped into the water at some point of the river and continued to spread with its flow (1, 3, 2, 4, 5). The chemical pollutant could not be identified because the investigations started to late (4, 5). In the field of science, they talk about a failure of governmental communication and collaboration (2, 4, 5). Water samples were sent to laboratories in different countries to help identifying the cause (5). What seems clear to all institutions is that the life in the Oder-river has been disrupted and that it will take years for fishes and mollusks to come back to its banks. But why is the research focus so limited to the restoration of a former state of nature? How is it that, although it is agreed that nature is constantly evolving and adapting, so little research is done on the potential of the newly introduced microorganisms that populate the river from now on? The Oder-river comes from the Czech Republic, passes through Poland and Germany and continues their border till it flows into the Baltic Sea. It\u2019s a flowing water that does not stop neither change its qualities according to the made-up lines nation-states draw upon it. Yet the responsibility over the quality of the water is divided to different authorities which causes an inability to response, the lack of response-ability for environmental conditions like this. Environmental scientist James Lovelock criticized the growing disinterest in global phenomena and interdependencies in biology, where he felt it was so necessary to. Instead of focusing on molecular biology and genetic evolution, the small picture of biology research, scientist should return to seeing the big picture and start contextualizing biological phenomena (6). For Lovelock, the study of life had to be holistic; scientist should approach life as one whole organism rather focusing exclusively on the examinations of molecules and atoms (6). This would open our eyes to the self-regulating forces and feedback-systems of nature and how we can adapt our actions and sciences to them. What is happening in the examination of the Oder-river this summer is an example of science breaking wholeness into pieces and trying to restore a previous environmental state. Yet if there would be a non-human centric approach to the situation, scientist could start looking for collaboration with the more-than-human organisms inhabiting the Oder-river. There is agreement that changing climatic conditions in terms of a warmer atmosphere have also led to the appearance of golden algae. The greenhouse gas effect that helps warming up the Earth is being intensively researched, and one of its solutions is seen in algal growth. In 2007, Lovelock presented a technical proposal to stimulate algal growth, \u201cto draw down extra carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and increase the formation of sunlight-reflecting clouds that would decrease global heating\u201c(7). Prymnesium parvum has been known since 1985 and its lethal potential has been extensively studied. Using morphological studies and genome sequencing, scientists are finding out about its potential to form and spread viruses. Similar techniques can be used to determine the potential for carbon sequestration and the algae\u2019s purpose in its wider context of a global climatological changes. As a microalga, it \u201cassimilates CO2 during autotrophic growth and produces biomass for various applications, including bioenergy production\u201d(8). The dispute between Poland and Germany about the responsibility of the Oder-disaster, shows how, like the division of land into countries, science\u2019s approach to study specifies, sometimes fails to integrate particular events into wider interdependent phenomena. Instead of blaming each other and trying to find the cause of this environmental disaster in a particular chemical pollutant released by a particular institution or person, scientists could focus on the potential collaboration with this emerging organism and see how the Oder-river could be a potential tool for carbon sequestration and rebalancing the Earth\u2019s biosphere. sources: news reports: (1) https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/8/14/photos-germany-poland-mystery-surrounds-mass-fish-deaths-in-the-oder-river (2) https://phys.org/news/2022-09-germany-mass-fish-deaths-oder.html (3) https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rare-toxic-algae-behind-fish-deaths-river-oder-say-researchers-2022-08-19/ (4) https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62688036 (5) https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/rare-golden-algae-may-have-caused-fish-deaths-in-oder-river-says-minister scientific backing: (6) James E.

Instead of blaming each other and trying to find the cause of this environmental disaster in a particular chemical pollutant released by a particular institution or person, scientists could focus on the potential collaboration with this emerging organism and see how the Oder-river could be a potential tool for carbon sequestration and rebalancing the Earth\u2019s biosphere. sources: news reports: (1) https://www.aljazeera.com/gallery/2022/8/14/photos-germany-poland-mystery-surrounds-mass-fish-deaths-in-the-oder-river (2) https://phys.org/news/2022-09-germany-mass-fish-deaths-oder.html (3) https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rare-toxic-algae-behind-fish-deaths-river-oder-say-researchers-2022-08-19/ (4) https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-62688036 (5) https://www.theguardian.com/world/2022/aug/19/rare-golden-algae-may-have-caused-fish-deaths-in-oder-river-says-minister scientific backing: (6) James E.

These problems are interconnected, interdependent and always manifest in place and culture-specific ways. Transition Design argues that new knowledge and skill-sets are required to address these problems, and that their resolution is a strategy for igniting positive, systems-level change and societal transitions toward more sustainable, equitable and desirable long-term futures\u201d Merce Rua introduced us into the way that HOLON transition design and through that, facilitate sustainable and social progress. the collective design for communities by engaging themselves in them and taking in the role of facilitators. this enables complexities to be acknowledged and guiding force. as a facilitator, one aims to find a balance in active and passive space creation, including and excluding influential factors. she summarized six steps for us that guides HOLON in their work 1 sense and understand system dynamic: here actant mapping can be a useful technique to understand the forces at stake 2 identify pressure and leverage points 3 build more desirable future visions: coming up with alternative realities 4 crafting an intervention portfolio to plot who else is in the system: coming up with practical implementations 5 probe, sense, respond: waiting for the system to react 6 practice the back casting: starting with the future vision and go background to the present in a transition pathway this builds on Donella Meadows , who is a system researcher that was part of the author team who wrote the limits to growth. she generally speaks of 12 points of leverage in every system, 12 points in which you can start, intervene. here, action can take place and will have an impact. more detailed notes on what theories we engaged in can be followed here what I take away \u00b6 during this week I am engaging with the work of Thom van Dooren and other thinkers that write about our ability to respond to the \u201eworld of mass extinction in which we find ourselves in\u201d . out \u201eresponse-ability to make decisions in the presence of those who bear their consequences\u201d . In Multispecies Studies - Cultivating Arts of Attentiveness , the three authors ask the question, \u201ewho benefits when species meet?\u201d it is this meeting that I am trying to grasp, this meeting which seems so essential to how we, how they, how the us will go on. tthe decisions we make today are about how the all \u201ewill get on inside a world that is, however multiple, also shared, finite, and (in many ways) struggling\u201c . this is what I take from this week, a response-ability to listen, a question that might not be up to me to speak up for but which I might possibly facilitate to echo in my silences. \u201eWhat does it mean to hold open space for another?\u201d exercise transition in a creative community \u00b6 from the actant map I choose the urban cycle as actant whose agency I would like to change: creative community: water-consumption awareness in urban environments (Valldaura as a research lab?) context: access to water in the world is unequal and unfair. tthose with power (economic monopoly) decide how and where water is allocated, while in regions of economic and political instability freshwater is scarce, even if there are natural reserves. current situation: in Barcelona, the freshwater infrastructure is well developed and well thought out. the water comes from two rivers and the water reservoirs under the earth\u2019s surface. There are even desalination plants that help make seawater drinkable for humans. here, citizens consume about 122 liters of fresh drinking water every day. most of it is used to wash clothes and flush away excrement. in parts of the world where infrastructures are not so well developed and political and economic authorities are not so concerned about an even distribution of water resources to their citizens, a daily consumption of 10-15 liters of water is not exceptional. in these areas, fresh water is mainly used for drinking and washing one\u2019s body. according to international health organizations, a person who has access to less than 40 liters of fresh water per day is considered water poor. so if we consume 122 liters of water, of which only 2 liters at most enter our bodies directly through drinking, and are unaware of where the other 120 liters go, this seems problematic in view of the increasing scarcity of freshwater resources globally. engagements and limits: creating awareness about well-established patterns and habits is not easy. especially not when the impacts are not directly felt but outsourced to distant places. therefore, engagement must happen in closed environments in which impact is created, seen, and can be followed. a possible example would be the creation of a working-bubble (Valldaura labs?) in which a water cycle is represented as an interdependent unit within global climatological systems. this bears its limits because it created a reality that is not directly linked to the reality urban dwellers live in. theory of change: structural change is always hard to inspire because it asks for infrastructural and habitual transformations that are time and thought intensive. yet habitual changes often come by changes in convictions and realizations about newly discovered knowledges. here, changes occur when trends become mainstream, when things are figured out and a path is mapped out. a dominant theory of change might approach transition to conscious water consumption with the idea of measure, control, change. in this case it has its limits as we experience that measuring and controlling water consumption in the city context is almost impossible. living with the infrastructure of the homes and of the entities visited in cities, fresh water is used very often unconscious and out of habit. therefore, I propose to prototype cultures that deal with water consciously. having examples (like a Valldaura lab bubble) of how conscious water consumption could work inspires, motivates, and shows that the unthinkable is actually possible. design challenges and opportunity: challenges: \u2022 pre-made infrastructures in houses and water-resource management \u2022 knowledge about what freshwater is and what it means to the global ecosystem \u2022 attention to individual usage of water \u2022 habits of using fresh-water with the thought of it being endlessly renewed \u2022 \u2026 opportunities: \u2022 increased water scarcity on a global scale (increased media attention) \u2022 droughts on a local scale led to water restrictions in the city; in other parts floodings on a local scale led to the destruction of all kinds of essential infrastructures in cities \u2022 the consequences of the lack of access to fresh water are easily perceived as a major threat \u2022 water is a renewable resource, and its cycle is made visible relatively easy in DIY experiments \u2022 \u2026","title":"community engagement"},{"location":"term1/communityengagement/communityengagement/#_1","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 8 / 22 - 26 November 2022","title":""},{"location":"term1/communityengagement/communityengagement/#community-engagement","text":"with Markel Cormenzana and Merce Rua from HOLON in Casa Batllo this course aims to show how the design practice and the role of the designer has been evolving over time. instead of seeing our work as a service (design over), or as a means to satisfy users needs (design for), design practices today deal with the agency of all involved throughout the process (design with). with this frame in mind we talked about creative communities and the potentialities of transitioning. but mainly this week was a week full of exploring design . eventually we talked about the responsibility of providing spaces that enable, allow, and support the meeting . we talked about the intersection of fields and species, of research and experiences; the places where traditions manifest their roots in new soils. we talked about creating dialogues in various ways. creating dialogues in a) affirmative or b) critical ways.

There are even desalination plants that help make seawater drinkable for humans. here, citizens consume about 122 liters of fresh drinking water every day. most of it is used to wash clothes and flush away excrement. in parts of the world where infrastructures are not so well developed and political and economic authorities are not so concerned about an even distribution of water resources to their citizens, a daily consumption of 10-15 liters of water is not exceptional. in these areas, fresh water is mainly used for drinking and washing one\u2019s body. according to international health organizations, a person who has access to less than 40 liters of fresh water per day is considered water poor. so if we consume 122 liters of water, of which only 2 liters at most enter our bodies directly through drinking, and are unaware of where the other 120 liters go, this seems problematic in view of the increasing scarcity of freshwater resources globally. engagements and limits: creating awareness about well-established patterns and habits is not easy. especially not when the impacts are not directly felt but outsourced to distant places. therefore, engagement must happen in closed environments in which impact is created, seen, and can be followed. a possible example would be the creation of a working-bubble (Valldaura labs?) in which a water cycle is represented as an interdependent unit within global climatological systems. this bears its limits because it created a reality that is not directly linked to the reality urban dwellers live in. theory of change: structural change is always hard to inspire because it asks for infrastructural and habitual transformations that are time and thought intensive. yet habitual changes often come by changes in convictions and realizations about newly discovered knowledges. here, changes occur when trends become mainstream, when things are figured out and a path is mapped out. a dominant theory of change might approach transition to conscious water consumption with the idea of measure, control, change. in this case it has its limits as we experience that measuring and controlling water consumption in the city context is almost impossible. living with the infrastructure of the homes and of the entities visited in cities, fresh water is used very often unconscious and out of habit. therefore, I propose to prototype cultures that deal with water consciously. having examples (like a Valldaura lab bubble) of how conscious water consumption could work inspires, motivates, and shows that the unthinkable is actually possible. design challenges and opportunity: challenges: \u2022 pre-made infrastructures in houses and water-resource management \u2022 knowledge about what freshwater is and what it means to the global ecosystem \u2022 attention to individual usage of water \u2022 habits of using fresh-water with the thought of it being endlessly renewed \u2022 \u2026 opportunities: \u2022 increased water scarcity on a global scale (increased media attention) \u2022 droughts on a local scale led to water restrictions in the city; in other parts floodings on a local scale led to the destruction of all kinds of essential infrastructures in cities \u2022 the consequences of the lack of access to fresh water are easily perceived as a major threat \u2022 water is a renewable resource, and its cycle is made visible relatively easy in DIY experiments \u2022 \u2026","title":"exercise transition in a creative community"},{"location":"term1/designstudioI/designstudio1/","text":"\u00b6 design studio I \u00b6 with Oscar Tomico and Mariana Quintero the MDEF design studio aims to bring project ideas into an advanced concretion point, and execution plan.

Oscar Tomico introduced us to four different roles that prototyping can play in design practice and enquiry processes. (1) prototype serves as an experimental component: here a hypothesis is tested (2) prototype serves as a means of inquiry: here an open-minded exploration is performed and the pt is the instrument (3) prototype serves as a research archetype: here the pt serves as an illustration and demonstration to show possible results of the research (4) prototype serves as a directing tool for inquiry: here the making-process (with all involved agents) of the pt is helping to direct the research fast scaling and fast failing are important to the design practice as this is what helps to understand the granularity of situational contexts in which a design intervention is thought to have impact. personal experience with these four roles of prototyping \u00b6 a prototype\u2019s role as a hypothesis tester is in my experience common in scientific and architectural research. at least in social research, we often make up hypothesis and then go on quantitative or qualitative investigations trying to falsify our assumptions. also in architectural design processes, I experienced the theoretical anticipation of certain scenarios and a subsequent practical approach of making small-scale models to test whether the ideas were accurate. for my project on unequal access to water (in terms of quantity and quality) I would like to investigate without prior assumptions. but I can imagine that at certain moments it makes sense to focus on a particular hypothesis and its application. this will help to concentrate the research area. as a mean of inquiry , prototypes were essential to my bachelor-thesis that dealt with the influence of one\u2019s social surrounding on one\u2019s environmental attitude. the qualitative interviews I conducted had a clear guideline, which I adapted depending on the recipient and the situation. I conducted each interview only once and weaved the obtained data into my observations. another social research I implemented was a quantitative survey on the housing situation among art students in Amsterdam. the survey was my tool to obtain the data I was looking for. in both cases, the topic was clear yet there was no outcome assumed. to find out how water is consumed by the inhabitants of Barcelona, I can use prototypes of water filters, water measures etc. to obtain relevant data within a framework yet without prior expectations. Furthermore, I can be the prototype myself to observe patterns in water consumption (regarding quantity and quality). as an archetypal prototype , I once wrote a fictional story about a future in which a virtual object provides the framework for a society that has sterilized themselves to the extent that Earth seems toxic in every sense. building on the data I have received from myself as a prototype, I can also use myself as an archetypal prototype: I can determine the access and the amount of water I have; I can embody what access and consumption looks like in different areas and situational contexts (in Barcelona and beyond), etc.. the last role of prototypes, the one where prototypes serve as vehicles for enquiry , is one that I have probably unconsciously explored a lot. here, the research itself directs the area of exploration.

Hypothetical questions are posed here to stimulate the collective imagination with the concept of \u201cwhat if\u201d. design in the 2020s is about processes, not outcomes. the proposals are tools for a systematic approach to redesigning and for grasping interconnections and interdependencies. they aim to design across boundaries - in a collective and collaborative way to meet the many demands arising from the environmental emergency. the proposals cover 10 important points that are framed as hypothetical questions in the catalogue : Identity, Time, Problems, Scope, Growth, Energy, Business Models, Decision, Learning, Design. words shape worlds \u00b6 it matter what words we use to make words as an example of the power of words, we are redefining our descriptions of the planet. the dominant narrative of planet Earth is that it is our place, our home - and it is only our human centrism why we call it planet Earth and not planet water , because basically there is more water than earth on its surface. one of Andres\u2019 main incentives was to make us aware of the wording we use. instead of using the singular \u201cfuture\u201d when we talk about all that we have not yet experienced, we explicitly say that there are many potential stories that we will live \u2013 that we are becoming futures . we talked about the crisis of imagination and how it is becoming a real threat to human society if we completely loose our sociological imagination. we cannot understand any kind of economy (e.g. digital economy) outside of an ecological framework. critical hope \u00b6 in their project Billion Seconds Institute , they talk about intercitizenships (in its plural form again). this refers to dynamic processes and not to inherited privileges, its about becoming rather than being as intercitizenships are more-than-human. the aim with this wording is not to find differences between nations and its citizens but rather focus on common patters. the one billion seconds institute is a tool for thinking beyond what it means to be a citizen today, it is about economies of reciprocity and generosity \u2013 the term inter refers to reciprocal generosity. the futures are made of collective rights that come with collective duties. relating to this, there is an interesting reading I am engaging with these days: a text by Alberto Alt\u00e9s Arlandis and Oren Lieberman\u2019s called intraventions in flux . the authors propose to replace the term \u2018inter\u2019 with \u2018intra\u2019, the first referring to something happening between two or more actants, whereas the latter, intra\u2019 indicates something happening within the dynamics at stake. in line with an Object Oriented Ontology (OOO), which deconstruct the center and approaches all participating actants (things) in a situation as equally important an infuential, Arlandis and Lieberman outline how our attentiveness to what on ongoingly happening, defines the in-formation of identities and spaces. \u2026 as they move, we move along . So even more than seeing futures as a inter-relationship between entities, talking about intra-vening in current systematic thinkings about possible futures allows to take in a perspective from within the systems itself. to practice this critical hope we put ourselves into a situation one billion seconds from now and imagined our daily life additionally, we were invited to write a letter send by our future-self in the 2050s \u2018(thus one billion seconds from now) positionality statement \u00b6 \u201cIn Europe, we speak of minorities and diversity, but the truth is that the West\u2019s minorities are the global majority \u2013 diversity is our norm\u201d Lesley Lokko \u201cPositionality refers to the connections between place, identities, self-understanding, and relationships with people. It is defined by institutions, laws, and cultures are designed by those in power to give you access to resources, social capital, and rights\u201d positionality media . therefore, positionality concerns background, age, gender, race, ethnicity, ability, first language, sexual orientation, educational background, geographical location, economic situation, and many other components that influence our daily life experiences, the lessons we teach our children and the legacies we leave behind. Saying all of this is nothing new, it is well-known that Identities are not fixed but a result of a complex social network that interact with each other. In there, we occupy a unique social space based on our experience and background. Reflecting on the experiences I make in the spaces I move in, helps me to clarify how I navigate through this world. And how I do not navigate through other worlds. It can help me to find the blind spots I don\u2019t see because of the privileges that come with the position I take and those I don\u2019t. By looking at my positionality, I reveal the intersectionality (Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw coined the term to give voice to black woman\u2019s frustrations experiences in the white feminist movement) of my various selves. So, it seems a good idea to reflect again and again which positions I take, and which positions I don\u2019t take. Furthermore, when executing research, it is important to state my positionality towards the research I am conducting. The aim is to create transparency about the biases that shape the investigation. This includes reflecting on my social position and on the theoretical lenses I wear. When I speak, you will hear about the realities that I perceive of the world I find myself in.","title":"a billion from now"},{"location":"term2/billionsec/billionsec/#_1","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 12 / 11 - 13 January 2023","title":""},{"location":"term2/billionsec/billionsec/#designing-for-the-next-billion-seconds","text":"with Andr\u00e9s Colmenares the course designing for the next billion seconds was made from the love and energy that Andr\u00e9s Colmenares brought to us. it was a course about storytelling and futures and how we can imagine them. actually, it is the first time, we are (collectively) imagining the futures; with long-term, critical and planetary mindsets. we talked about how to navigate the complexity, scale, and speed of transformations of the multidimensional implications of an environmental emergency.

Saying all of this is nothing new, it is well-known that Identities are not fixed but a result of a complex social network that interact with each other. In there, we occupy a unique social space based on our experience and background. Reflecting on the experiences I make in the spaces I move in, helps me to clarify how I navigate through this world. And how I do not navigate through other worlds. It can help me to find the blind spots I don\u2019t see because of the privileges that come with the position I take and those I don\u2019t. By looking at my positionality, I reveal the intersectionality (Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw coined the term to give voice to black woman\u2019s frustrations experiences in the white feminist movement) of my various selves. So, it seems a good idea to reflect again and again which positions I take, and which positions I don\u2019t take. Furthermore, when executing research, it is important to state my positionality towards the research I am conducting. The aim is to create transparency about the biases that shape the investigation. This includes reflecting on my social position and on the theoretical lenses I wear.

I now feel that I have a broader tool and reference box to draw from. I hope that next semester I will be able to combine both approaches and find satisfaction and (self-)realisation in the processes that arise from the contexts I will find myself in. three take-aways from the last term: 1. think about how to integrate more-than-human entities into the MDEFs concept of \u201ccommunity\u201d 2. allowing myself to focus on what\u2019s interesting to me, also if this is linked to non-material things such as poetry and writings 3. record, reflect and document (structured and consistently) the emerging situationships the first interventions I co-facilitated were broad and related to multi-species collaborations and integrative design processes. as events unfolded, I realized that I am not interested in multispecies design practices per se.

Oscar shows us every corner of the plant world and the moment I accidentilly touch a hanging branch with bright green leaves, he immediately draws my attention to it. it is only some time later, that Myrto and me sit in her living room and listen individually to the audio file, now having all the papers and pens in front of us, writing down quotes, point out agents and draw lines and arrows that connect and disconnect. after doing this on our selfs and on our own, we combine it in a digital space (our favorite tool: the miro board). what will happen next and if there will be a follow up mapping about the possisble futures of how oscar and plants are relating is still in the stars. for now we keep it what it is, a first person observation of a first person perspective on what it meanss to live-with plants. imaginar mundus possibles in disseny hub \u00b6 on 19.01.2023. presenting our paper on the importance of storytelling together with Myrto we spend the christmas vacations on reading, writing, rereading and rewriting. after the last design dialogues, myrto and me applied with a simple idea to a complex conference on speculative futures organized by the esbrina research group . its name: imaginar mundos posibles: Potencialidades, l\u00edmites y fricciones de la ficci\u00f3n especulativa en la investigaci\u00f3n y la educaci\u00f3n . the paper we wrote emphasizes the importance of creating and listening to stories in a world where few voices and stories are being noticed. we argue that stories are essential for going beyond monophonic and catastrophic narratives, and that they are a form of \u201cattunement\u201d to the worlds we find ourselves in. we propose a method for diversifying narratives about the future by democratizing storytelling and using speculative fiction as a tool. based on Timothy Morton\u2019s concept of a \u201cmesh\u201d, we propose a mapping technique that creates space for entangled narratives to evolve, encouraging participants to speculate about fictional scenarios that play out in this \u201cweb of life\u201d. our presentation at the conference can be watched on youtube and the paper will soon be published (in an internal publication of the conference) and you can access it here the conference took place over the course of two full days that were filled with presentations (in castellano and catalan) of other researchers that deal with speculative fiction in the course of design methodologies. it was very interesting to listen to and we got in contact with curious minds and experiences practitioners. on friday afternoon we had the change to meet Yuri Tuma who both, Myrto and me are following due to his participattion in the artist collective the institute for posttnatural studies whose practice we both admire. this two-hour workshop left us enthiusastic about our own practice and with lots of ideas and contacts of how and with whom to continue our journey in the coming weeks. the traveller start their journey \u00b6 end of january till end of february at Ombu as part of the design dialogues in december we made a sculpture that wears a lot of questions and QR-codes. the QR-codes lead to a online platform where questionos are (re)framed in a digital way. the attempt is to interact with an open (human) community that expands the bubble we are moving in in our everyday lifes. therefore we aim to reach out to as much voices as possible, the idea is to make this sculpture a traveling work that can venture to multiple places. the first stop is our neighbor-cafe whose owners very soon became our friends, Omb\u00fa . we are aware that the chosen questions, cafes, neighborhoods will not crazily deviate from our personap bubble, yet this is a way to prototype our thinking for now. space for narrating the future of education \u00b6 on 25.03.2023. facilitating a space with myrto First workshop 25 th of February 2023, Barcelona, sun is shining, 10 degreed Celsius. It is a Saturday morning; we are meeting in the studio of our friend and mentor Jana in Raval. We have invited for 11 o clock, by 11:30 we are all together, had some tea and fruit and are coming together to stand in a circle. A short introduction round makes us realize the bubble we are in. Amanda from the States, a MDEF student who is interested in the creation of a makerspace and who loves the self-sufficiency of coding- and electronics. Maria from Italy, who is one of the inviters roommates and works in the social sector with people with disabilities. Nithin from India, who works at Glovo as a UX expert and who is writing his master thesis on speculative-, transition-, and pluriversal design. Korbi from Switzerland, who is a MDEF Master student and concerned with the exploitation of the labor force and the search for new ways to life without work. Georgio from Switzerland, who is his friend and curious to pass by. Daphne from Greece, who is an ex-MDEF student and after finishing a few years ago continued her journey in future design dealing with system and imaginations of speculating. Quim from Spain, who is a geography professor and artist in Lleida and has various practices that deal with the interaction of space and learning processes. Jana from spain, who is an ex-MDEF student and is interested in transhumanistic ways of thinking and designing. Claudia from Italy, who is a MEDF student and is interested in the change of social behavior towards a more conscious consumption of resources. And the two facilitators Myrto and Stella from Greece and Germany, who are MDEF students and interested in disrupting binary thinkings and exploring polyphonic narration. All in all, we are between 24 and 40 years old, white and somewhat linked to the topic of the invitation \u2013 the educational system and how it is changing. Before introducing the topic and goal of the day, we are asked to close our eyes and settle into our body and into the space we are in. A few guided breathings and we open our eyer again to meet each other in concentration and curiousness. The next few hours will be guided along three phases of transition \u2013 we will unfamiliarize, grief, and rebirth by the help of three exercises. We will be dealing with a transition that is happening and that we all have experienced somehow close or far \u2013 the switch from solely in-person learning and teaching to hybrid forms that come with the introduction of the internet and globally accessible platforms that enable online and live exchanges. We divide into three groups, taking in the perspectives of either teachers, students, or means of communication. Within the groups we discuss and dialogue about what the above mentioned transition would mean for our position, what would change practically and how would it affect our position emotionally? After about half an hour, we meet with the other groups in a standing circle and each group presents its burning issues. A discussion starts to evolve. It seems difficult to argue from the group\u2019s perspective and participants often appeal to their personal interests. For example, does Quim, who choose to represent means of communication, easily fall back into his actual role as a university professor and argues for the perspectives of the teacher. For the students, who all were students at one point in their lives (in this case not even very long ago and mostly still are), the participants refer to lived experiences. A discussion about the differences in legal regulation and the lack of digital skills arises. Soon all three groups agree on the current goals and deficits, which are not compatible with each other. We go into the next phase; After having unfamiliarized with what is known by taking in new perspectives and seeing what else there is at play, we continue into the grieving part. In the same groups we are asked to discuss what heritage we want to pass on, what essential qualities of the roles should not be forgotten but will eventually be something that is no longer practiced. For this phase the facilitators have calculated less time and after 20 min bring back the circle and we exchange the values we will be missing. This leads to a mapping of all the values that seem essential for learning and teaching, even in a digital future. Here, too, personal experiences, fears and desires are referred to and inspire our thoughts and words. Someone mentions the potentiality of hybridness and starts drawing a scenario in which these values can be kept while allowing digital spaces to take over (some of) the physical learning places. We are slowly transitioning into the third phase our day \u2013 the rebirth.

The studio with the low ceiling and the cold windows falls silent. We hear the pens on the paper, the teeth biting lips. When the facilitators announce five more minutes there is revolt, there is need for more time. Then we come together and place all our scripts face down on the floor in the middle of our standing circle. One by one we pick up a paper and read out loud what is written on it. Then we decide together if this is something we can imagine in a future education system that has made the transition from exclusively personal learning. There is a lot of movement now, we stand still, but there is laughter and discussion about all kinds of related implications. We discard the papers that are not wanted in our model and in this way build up a stack of propositions describing (parts of) an educational system that we would like to learn and teach with. A third stack of papers is the place for all the scripts we are not so enthusiastic about. The ones where we don\u2019t really know whether to give them a chance or discard them straight away. After three rounds, and many repetitions of readings, the floor in our midst is empty again. It is getting late, and as the participants have to leave at 2pm, we are led again into a closed-eye breathing, to ourselves and the space, before some words of gratitude end the session for the day.

Oscar shows us every corner of the plant world and the moment I accidentilly touch a hanging branch with bright green leaves, he immediately draws my attention to it. it is only some time later, that Myrto and me sit in her living room and listen individually to the audio file, now having all the papers and pens in front of us, writing down quotes, point out agents and draw lines and arrows that connect and disconnect. after doing this on our selfs and on our own, we combine it in a digital space (our favorite tool: the miro board). what will happen next and if there will be a follow up mapping about the possisble futures of how oscar and plants are relating is still in the stars. for now we keep it what it is, a first person observation of a first person perspective on what it meanss to live-with plants.","title":"plativerse"},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/interventions2/collectiveinterventions2/#imaginar-mundus-possibles-in-disseny-hub","text":"on 19.01.2023. presenting our paper on the importance of storytelling together with Myrto we spend the christmas vacations on reading, writing, rereading and rewriting. after the last design dialogues, myrto and me applied with a simple idea to a complex conference on speculative futures organized by the esbrina research group . its name: imaginar mundos posibles: Potencialidades, l\u00edmites y fricciones de la ficci\u00f3n especulativa en la investigaci\u00f3n y la educaci\u00f3n . the paper we wrote emphasizes the importance of creating and listening to stories in a world where few voices and stories are being noticed. we argue that stories are essential for going beyond monophonic and catastrophic narratives, and that they are a form of \u201cattunement\u201d to the worlds we find ourselves in. we propose a method for diversifying narratives about the future by democratizing storytelling and using speculative fiction as a tool. based on Timothy Morton\u2019s concept of a \u201cmesh\u201d, we propose a mapping technique that creates space for entangled narratives to evolve, encouraging participants to speculate about fictional scenarios that play out in this \u201cweb of life\u201d. our presentation at the conference can be watched on youtube and the paper will soon be published (in an internal publication of the conference) and you can access it here the conference took place over the course of two full days that were filled with presentations (in castellano and catalan) of other researchers that deal with speculative fiction in the course of design methodologies. it was very interesting to listen to and we got in contact with curious minds and experiences practitioners. on friday afternoon we had the change to meet Yuri Tuma who both, Myrto and me are following due to his participattion in the artist collective the institute for posttnatural studies whose practice we both admire. this two-hour workshop left us enthiusastic about our own practice and with lots of ideas and contacts of how and with whom to continue our journey in the coming weeks.","title":"imaginar mundus possibles in disseny hub"},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/interventions2/collectiveinterventions2/#the-traveller-start-their-journey","text":"end of january till end of february at Ombu as part of the design dialogues in december we made a sculpture that wears a lot of questions and QR-codes. the QR-codes lead to a online platform where questionos are (re)framed in a digital way. the attempt is to interact with an open (human) community that expands the bubble we are moving in in our everyday lifes. therefore we aim to reach out to as much voices as possible, the idea is to make this sculpture a traveling work that can venture to multiple places. the first stop is our neighbor-cafe whose owners very soon became our friends, Omb\u00fa . we are aware that the chosen questions, cafes, neighborhoods will not crazily deviate from our personap bubble, yet this is a way to prototype our thinking for now.","title":"the traveller start their journey"},{"location":"term2/designstudio2/interventions2/collectiveinterventions2/#space-for-narrating-the-future-of-education","text":"on 25.03.2023. facilitating a space with myrto First workshop 25 th of February 2023, Barcelona, sun is shining, 10 degreed Celsius. It is a Saturday morning; we are meeting in the studio of our friend and mentor Jana in Raval. We have invited for 11 o clock, by 11:30 we are all together, had some tea and fruit and are coming together to stand in a circle. A short introduction round makes us realize the bubble we are in. Amanda from the States, a MDEF student who is interested in the creation of a makerspace and who loves the self-sufficiency of coding- and electronics. Maria from Italy, who is one of the inviters roommates and works in the social sector with people with disabilities. Nithin from India, who works at Glovo as a UX expert and who is writing his master thesis on speculative-, transition-, and pluriversal design. Korbi from Switzerland, who is a MDEF Master student and concerned with the exploitation of the labor force and the search for new ways to life without work. Georgio from Switzerland, who is his friend and curious to pass by. Daphne from Greece, who is an ex-MDEF student and after finishing a few years ago continued her journey in future design dealing with system and imaginations of speculating. Quim from Spain, who is a geography professor and artist in Lleida and has various practices that deal with the interaction of space and learning processes. Jana from spain, who is an ex-MDEF student and is interested in transhumanistic ways of thinking and designing. Claudia from Italy, who is a MEDF student and is interested in the change of social behavior towards a more conscious consumption of resources. And the two facilitators Myrto and Stella from Greece and Germany, who are MDEF students and interested in disrupting binary thinkings and exploring polyphonic narration. All in all, we are between 24 and 40 years old, white and somewhat linked to the topic of the invitation \u2013 the educational system and how it is changing. Before introducing the topic and goal of the day, we are asked to close our eyes and settle into our body and into the space we are in. A few guided breathings and we open our eyer again to meet each other in concentration and curiousness. The next few hours will be guided along three phases of transition \u2013 we will unfamiliarize, grief, and rebirth by the help of three exercises. We will be dealing with a transition that is happening and that we all have experienced somehow close or far \u2013 the switch from solely in-person learning and teaching to hybrid forms that come with the introduction of the internet and globally accessible platforms that enable online and live exchanges. We divide into three groups, taking in the perspectives of either teachers, students, or means of communication. Within the groups we discuss and dialogue about what the above mentioned transition would mean for our position, what would change practically and how would it affect our position emotionally? After about half an hour, we meet with the other groups in a standing circle and each group presents its burning issues. A discussion starts to evolve. It seems difficult to argue from the group\u2019s perspective and participants often appeal to their personal interests. For example, does Quim, who choose to represent means of communication, easily fall back into his actual role as a university professor and argues for the perspectives of the teacher. For the students, who all were students at one point in their lives (in this case not even very long ago and mostly still are), the participants refer to lived experiences. A discussion about the differences in legal regulation and the lack of digital skills arises. Soon all three groups agree on the current goals and deficits, which are not compatible with each other. We go into the next phase; After having unfamiliarized with what is known by taking in new perspectives and seeing what else there is at play, we continue into the grieving part. In the same groups we are asked to discuss what heritage we want to pass on, what essential qualities of the roles should not be forgotten but will eventually be something that is no longer practiced.

Marielle and Carolina had already found each other and merged their POC-experience-frustrations into a concrete idea of working with the ignorance of white people towards the statues of colonizers and their histories in the city (BCN). in my theoretical thoughworld I am dealing a lot with (de)colonial practices and anyways, this means re-telling stories and giving voice, so I stepped in to become the white addative to our multiracial team. Museum Of Colonialization (MOC) \u00b6 with marielle and carolina there are multiple spaces where I reflect on this weeks work, we worked in a miro board , maintained a notion page throughout the processs, and created a GitHub repository for an easy access to our files and experiences. here I will more individually reflect on the team work and my individual input. how we came together \u00b6 our overlapping interest show our common concern with the \u201ctruth\u201d we are being told and the way to tackle their revealments. we agree on that the present time was very poorly designed by a selective group and that it needs the uncovering of the dirty history of hidden public artifacts in order to embrace other futures (by other we mean the furthest point possible from patriarchy, capitalist and neo-colonist structures). in our ideation processes and references we encounter funny ways to deal with ignorance and cynical approaches to sillyness. what we provide \u00b6 we design a first prototype for a transparent gumball machine that contains easily digestible, fun(?) facts about the colonisers who have shaped the city. the idea is that one encounters it somewhere in the city, presses a button and opens the (paper) ball received. inside, one finds a sticker with the image of a coloniser and a fun(?) fact about that person. opening the paper ball reveals a letter asking the reader to follow the given coordinates and place the stickers at the location - which will be associated with the (legacy of the) person on the sticker. We aim to raise awareness and engage white citizens (whiteness here as a concept of power and privilege of the dominant group in society) who do not think about the people who were and are celebrated as homeland heroes, let alone know about their terrible deeds, and are often not interested enough to research the history themselves. that is why the machiene is supposed to operate in the multiverses of Barcelona and spit out the balls to those who actively make a promise to obtain knowledge. We call this gumball machine, the museum of colonialization (MOC). how we get there - in theory \u00b6 the first phases are thinking processes about how we want people to engage with the colonial past of the city. we come up with ideas of a toolkit to cast immediate environments and transform them into stamps, we think about pasting QR-codes onto statues that would lead to a digital environment of knowledge transmission. soon we venture to the idea of having a gumball machine that in exchange for a promise spits out little versions of the statues that are to be found in the city with their coordinates and some unpopular funny (or rather cynic?) facts about their background. we early on in the process agree upon making knowledge easily digestiable, not speaking to an intellectual public that(probably anyways) is concerned with the theme of (de)colonial practices but instead speak to all those people walking the streets without paying attention to the (come on, actually pretty obvious) colonial legacies. ok, so far so good, now it is just a matter of making a machiene that has a mechanism that spits out something (a ball) when pressing a buttom (to involve some arduino and coding here), little scultures that can be (dis)assembled (maybe press-fit with the lasercut), stickers on which there are coordinates and fun(?) facts about the represented persons (vinylcut), balls that can contain these sculptures (origami-shapes cut with laser or vinyl), and of course the research on the people we would like to display (our intellect of using the world wide web). We devide tasks. even if one of our main overlaps is anti-economic-growth, the division-of-labor-thought serves well in the right moments (also we unfortunately put ourselves into a system that operates based on progress and output). together, Marielle and Carolina would design the look of the gumball machine. then, Marielle would take over the mechanic parts and with their arduino skills. With the help of Carolina whereever she would be helpful and has time to do so. furthermore, Carolina would be busy with designing the contents about the colonizers - whereas the research we would do the three of us. due to expected time-limitation we already here decide to pick each one person that is represented somehow in the city of Barcelona and each focus on some facts about that person. I would be concerned with the design of the ball for now and then help where needed. We have another idea att that moment. Maybe, a promise is not enough? What if we could create an application that opens the camera app automatically, and registered whether a photo of the stickered statue is hashtagges somewhere on social media? Well, wee see, that might be something for another iteration. For now, lets start crafting\u2026 how we get there - in practice \u00b6 I will rather shortly reflect on this here and only focus on the work I did individually. all of this and more can be found in the GitHub repository in more detail. somehow I was fascinated even from before with the online tool for origami simulations . so we decided I would make the shell, the ball to contain the colonizers out of folded paper. the making of the origami spheres was more complex than I expected but I had a lot of fun and curious outcomes while working on it. the steps I took: - getting to know origamisimulator.org (origami model visualization - researching origami-simulator library for a fitting design - adapting the design according to our needs - translating the (rhino)file into a file readable by the lasercutter (lasercutter software) - laser-cutting the piece in paper (includes the trial of power and speed of laser) - folding the paper into balls - adapt size and form of the sphere in rhino - translating the rhino file into a file readable by the vinylprinter (silhuette studio software) - vinyl-printing the piece onto paper (includes the trial of blade-depth and force of vinyl-knife) - folding the paper into balls the origami-simulator is designed by an amanda who very helping explains how things work and offer some example files on her github page . yet to understand all of this, it took some time and to figure that files can be created and adapted in rhino to work in the simulator, took some more. to explain it short here, she has some example files under which one of an amazing sphere and the simulation shows clearly how it folds and unfolds. I downloaded this file, opened it in rhino, exploded the existing design and define groups and color codes anew, accoding to the needs of our balls. the online simulator reads SVGs in one way (File - Design Tips on the webpage ) (Mountain folds have red stroke - rgb(255, 0, 0), hex #ff0000; Valley folds have blue stroke - rgb(0, 0, 255), hex #0000ff; Boundary edges have black stroke - rgb(0, 0, 0), hex #000000) which can vary from the rules used in the lasercutter- and the vinylprinter software. here often you can define the actions and allocate them to colors of choice. but its important to keep in mind that the simulation SVGs do not necessarily have the same color-codes as the rhino-files used for printing. After exporting the rhino-drawing as an SVG, the simulator shows my first trials that where kind of beautiful yet definetely not as expected. here you can see the simulation okay, once I figured how it all works, I tried to immitade amandas design and to play with some drawings in rhino, to then upload these into the simulator and print with the vinylcutter. here you can see the simulation of the almost final piece - something is still wrong . so in the end it all seemed quit difficult to get the right proportions and stuff so I sticked to amandas file and just adapted the size to a A3 length in order to make it handy when printing. and look there, the fold paper looks pretty much like the simulation. in the end, what does it matter if I create the file myself or downloaded other peoples work? sharing is caring and I am sure amanda put them out there for us to make use of them. a few more things that came up while cutting and printing\u2026 we use paper (because we want to print text on them and have the hapticity of a entrance ticket or letter or something foldable that is easy to pocket away), meaning tha engraving the pattern in order to make fold easier have to be very precise not to cut through fully. my experience with the lasercut. I tried a variety of power and speeds and in the end came up with this settings (yet they vary for each lasercutter. I tried with another lasercutter and it was way to heavy there) but for the actual balls we did not make use of the lasercutter (mostly due to bad organization and availabilty of the lasercutter) but instead used the vinylcutter. this takes way longer and about the precision can be fought. but it had two great advantages\u2026 we could take it with us and for that work on it with immediate adaptations and because it has a blade instead of a laser, there are no traces of burning material to be seen in the end piece. for the vinyl print the final settings were the lowest possible for the folds and the standard cutting ones for the outline. okay, the making of the balls was thought to be the most easy and time-least intense task yet it turns out to keep us busy for quite some hours, days and evenings. in the end, we made it to these little creatures that thanks to Myrto got the name Armadillos (because they look like them\u2026). and heeeere in it\u2019s preliminary final state: what we overlooked \u00b6 rather than reflecting on my personal shortcomings and the ways I could have had invested more into this (which sadly was pretty much constrained by my health conditions this week), I will take some time to write a citique on our common output and the alignment with out initial intentions. critique on the muesum of decolonization \u00b6 in February 2023, three master\u2019s students in Barcelona design a first prototype for a transparent gumball machine that contains easily digestible, fun(?) facts about the colonisers who have shaped the city. the idea is that one encounters it somewhere in the city, presses a button and opens the (paper) ball received. inside, one finds a sticker with the image of a coloniser and a fun(?) fact about that person. opening the paper ball reveals a letter asking the reader to follow the given coordinates and place the stickers at the location - which will be associated with the (legacy of the) person on the sticker. the teams aim is to raise awareness and engage white citizens (whiteness here as a concept of power and privilege of the dominant group in society) who do not think about the people who were and are celebrated as homeland heroes, let alone know about their terrible deeds, and are often not interested enough to research the history themselves. that is why the machiene is supposed to operate in the multiverses of Barcelona and spit out the balls to those who actively make a promise to obtain knowledge. they call the maschiene, the museum of colonialization (MOC). in designing the prototype, the team fuses architectural components from different places (relevant to them), mainly from china town(s) and indigenous and traditional Angolan houses. The use of rounded corners and few straight lines is intentional to express the emotionally charged theme and the many inspiring unputs. in presenting their prototype, the multi-ethnic team shows their concern about the state of (BCN?) society, which is still far from actively practising decolonisation by addressing its legacy of power and resource distribution, the suppression of culture and language, and the imposition of Western values and ways of life in general. it is a process of undoing the effects of colonialism and challenging colonial values, such as the belief in the superiority of Western culture or the notion of progress as defined by industrialisation and economic growth. in this sense, using the term \u201cmuseum\u201d can be seen as difficult, as the whole concept of the \u201cmuseum\u201d is an invention of the colonisers who wanted to educate their home lands about the \u201cexoticism\u201d from overseas. museums to this day exhibit stolen cultural objects and are often seen as educational institutions where white values and knowledge are promoted. the MOC explodes the notion of an institution that you have to pay admission to visit in order to learn about (hi)stories. instead, the MOC displaces the whole city as a place where you can delve deeply into pasts and its impacts on the present - if you want to. yet it remains questionable to try to undo the colonial legacy with this very colonial concept of a museum by giving it that name. similarly, the imitation of a gumball machine. invented by a North American businessman in the 19 th century, these things represent the growth of consumerism, mass production and marketing. all in all, it is a manifestation of the commodification of (leisure) time. the team clearly speaks out against these capitalist values and their reproduction. while in typical gumball machines you pay with coins, here the exchange value is a promise. to start the Gumball, one must answer the question \u201cdo you want to visit the museum of colonialization?\u201d with the \u201cyes\u201d-buttom (the only existing). this is definitely a more mind-invested mechanism than giving money, yet it remains a means of exchange and feeds into patters of rapid consumption. it seems that the intention of the MOC is a brave one, but I have to ask if this implementation of an exchange-based colonialist-museum is not in contradiction with drawing attention to the fact that it is not the capitalist, western values on which the world is based? even if it is widly known that in order to teach, convince, engage with someone, one is ought to speak in their language and thus, if a audience is mainly white citizens and tourists from the states, the museum-gumball-machiene definetely speaks to man, I wonder if the engagement here happens on deep enough levels. february 19 th 2023 by stella dikmans","title":"micro challenges"},{"location":"term2/microchallenge/microchallenge/#_1","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 16 / 13 - 17 February 2023","title":""},{"location":"term2/microchallenge/microchallenge/#first-micro-challenge-week","text":"with Daphne, Josep, Santi, Mikel, Edu, Perta and Adai disclaimer, I was sick the entire week and am still recovering. meaning that my intellectual input into this project equals 0 (maybe not entirely, maybe 10-20%) because my brain was numb and its hard to think about something else then how to suppress the need to caugh or to refill the ginger-pepper-garlic-jar with hot water to make sure to stay hydrated. however, I showed up every day and put all energies I had into supporting my team whereever I could - and in the end it turned out that also my attendance was as essential as that of my dear sisters. okay, coming to the project itself\u2026 in the first micro-challenge week we are asked to implement some of the skills we learned (or not but at least got introduced to) the weeks coming up to this, like what lasercutting is, what parametrics are, how to code arduino sensor\u2026 my personal work evolves around storytelling, making up spaces for voices to resonate in and miking up the circles people find themselves thinking with. as I am in the MDEF programm at the moment working with myrto 24/7, we decided to took the chance to step back from our togetherness and let ourselves go with tthe flow of some other ideas.

We devide tasks. even if one of our main overlaps is anti-economic-growth, the division-of-labor-thought serves well in the right moments (also we unfortunately put ourselves into a system that operates based on progress and output). together, Marielle and Carolina would design the look of the gumball machine. then, Marielle would take over the mechanic parts and with their arduino skills. With the help of Carolina whereever she would be helpful and has time to do so. furthermore, Carolina would be busy with designing the contents about the colonizers - whereas the research we would do the three of us. due to expected time-limitation we already here decide to pick each one person that is represented somehow in the city of Barcelona and each focus on some facts about that person. I would be concerned with the design of the ball for now and then help where needed. We have another idea att that moment. Maybe, a promise is not enough? What if we could create an application that opens the camera app automatically, and registered whether a photo of the stickered statue is hashtagges somewhere on social media? Well, wee see, that might be something for another iteration.

I downloaded this file, opened it in rhino, exploded the existing design and define groups and color codes anew, accoding to the needs of our balls. the online simulator reads SVGs in one way (File - Design Tips on the webpage ) (Mountain folds have red stroke - rgb(255, 0, 0), hex #ff0000; Valley folds have blue stroke - rgb(0, 0, 255), hex #0000ff; Boundary edges have black stroke - rgb(0, 0, 0), hex #000000) which can vary from the rules used in the lasercutter- and the vinylprinter software. here often you can define the actions and allocate them to colors of choice. but its important to keep in mind that the simulation SVGs do not necessarily have the same color-codes as the rhino-files used for printing. After exporting the rhino-drawing as an SVG, the simulator shows my first trials that where kind of beautiful yet definetely not as expected. here you can see the simulation okay, once I figured how it all works, I tried to immitade amandas design and to play with some drawings in rhino, to then upload these into the simulator and print with the vinylcutter. here you can see the simulation of the almost final piece - something is still wrong . so in the end it all seemed quit difficult to get the right proportions and stuff so I sticked to amandas file and just adapted the size to a A3 length in order to make it handy when printing. and look there, the fold paper looks pretty much like the simulation. in the end, what does it matter if I create the file myself or downloaded other peoples work? sharing is caring and I am sure amanda put them out there for us to make use of them. a few more things that came up while cutting and printing\u2026 we use paper (because we want to print text on them and have the hapticity of a entrance ticket or letter or something foldable that is easy to pocket away), meaning tha engraving the pattern in order to make fold easier have to be very precise not to cut through fully. my experience with the lasercut. I tried a variety of power and speeds and in the end came up with this settings (yet they vary for each lasercutter. I tried with another lasercutter and it was way to heavy there) but for the actual balls we did not make use of the lasercutter (mostly due to bad organization and availabilty of the lasercutter) but instead used the vinylcutter. this takes way longer and about the precision can be fought. but it had two great advantages\u2026 we could take it with us and for that work on it with immediate adaptations and because it has a blade instead of a laser, there are no traces of burning material to be seen in the end piece. for the vinyl print the final settings were the lowest possible for the folds and the standard cutting ones for the outline. okay, the making of the balls was thought to be the most easy and time-least intense task yet it turns out to keep us busy for quite some hours, days and evenings. in the end, we made it to these little creatures that thanks to Myrto got the name Armadillos (because they look like them\u2026). and heeeere in it\u2019s preliminary final state:","title":"how we get there - in practice"},{"location":"term2/microchallenge/microchallenge/#what-we-overlooked","text":"rather than reflecting on my personal shortcomings and the ways I could have had invested more into this (which sadly was pretty much constrained by my health conditions this week), I will take some time to write a citique on our common output and the alignment with out initial intentions.","title":"what we overlooked"},{"location":"term2/microchallenge/microchallenge/#critique-on-the-muesum-of-decolonization","text":"in February 2023, three master\u2019s students in Barcelona design a first prototype for a transparent gumball machine that contains easily digestible, fun(?) facts about the colonisers who have shaped the city. the idea is that one encounters it somewhere in the city, presses a button and opens the (paper) ball received. inside, one finds a sticker with the image of a coloniser and a fun(?) fact about that person. opening the paper ball reveals a letter asking the reader to follow the given coordinates and place the stickers at the location - which will be associated with the (legacy of the) person on the sticker. the teams aim is to raise awareness and engage white citizens (whiteness here as a concept of power and privilege of the dominant group in society) who do not think about the people who were and are celebrated as homeland heroes, let alone know about their terrible deeds, and are often not interested enough to research the history themselves. that is why the machiene is supposed to operate in the multiverses of Barcelona and spit out the balls to those who actively make a promise to obtain knowledge. they call the maschiene, the museum of colonialization (MOC). in designing the prototype, the team fuses architectural components from different places (relevant to them), mainly from china town(s) and indigenous and traditional Angolan houses. The use of rounded corners and few straight lines is intentional to express the emotionally charged theme and the many inspiring unputs. in presenting their prototype, the multi-ethnic team shows their concern about the state of (BCN?) society, which is still far from actively practising decolonisation by addressing its legacy of power and resource distribution, the suppression of culture and language, and the imposition of Western values and ways of life in general. it is a process of undoing the effects of colonialism and challenging colonial values, such as the belief in the superiority of Western culture or the notion of progress as defined by industrialisation and economic growth. in this sense, using the term \u201cmuseum\u201d can be seen as difficult, as the whole concept of the \u201cmuseum\u201d is an invention of the colonisers who wanted to educate their home lands about the \u201cexoticism\u201d from overseas. museums to this day exhibit stolen cultural objects and are often seen as educational institutions where white values and knowledge are promoted. the MOC explodes the notion of an institution that you have to pay admission to visit in order to learn about (hi)stories. instead, the MOC displaces the whole city as a place where you can delve deeply into pasts and its impacts on the present - if you want to. yet it remains questionable to try to undo the colonial legacy with this very colonial concept of a museum by giving it that name. similarly, the imitation of a gumball machine. invented by a North American businessman in the 19 th century, these things represent the growth of consumerism, mass production and marketing. all in all, it is a manifestation of the commodification of (leisure) time. the team clearly speaks out against these capitalist values and their reproduction. while in typical gumball machines you pay with coins, here the exchange value is a promise. to start the Gumball, one must answer the question \u201cdo you want to visit the museum of colonialization?\u201d with the \u201cyes\u201d-buttom (the only existing). this is definitely a more mind-invested mechanism than giving money, yet it remains a means of exchange and feeds into patters of rapid consumption. it seems that the intention of the MOC is a brave one, but I have to ask if this implementation of an exchange-based colonialist-museum is not in contradiction with drawing attention to the fact that it is not the capitalist, western values on which the world is based? even if it is widly known that in order to teach, convince, engage with someone, one is ought to speak in their language and thus, if a audience is mainly white citizens and tourists from the states, the museum-gumball-machiene definetely speaks to man, I wonder if the engagement here happens on deep enough levels. february 19 th 2023 by stella dikmans","title":"critique on the muesum of decolonization"},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/","text":"\u00b6 \ud83d\uddd3 Week 14 / 01 February - 2023 prototyping for design with Edu, Victor, Santi, Josep, Aida and Petra (somehow) unexpectadly this course turned out to be a series of intense lectures with subsequent (self-)explorative adapation trials. theoretically we are introduced to the huge fields of advanced manufacturing, rapid prototyping and other new design methodologies by victor and edu that really did their best to hold us up motivated. we are very much encouraged to play around with the various tools accessible to us and make up some (hands-on? - the computer) experiences with digital fabrication tools. when we come to the micro-challenge-week we actually explorer what it means to physicalize digital realities\u2026 about electronics and codings \u00b6 with Victor with victor we party continued our conversation of transparentizing blackboxes we started off last term. similarly in in the coding world, a lot of things are kept in the dark and made complicated so users use user-oriented-design products that prevent individual agency through mystifying easy things. arduino is one of these projects that work for a transparent electronics as they aim to make coding more accessible to public and are all in for collective knowledges. we often consider Arduino being the wired-board that allows us to physicalize our codes yet actually arduino is a small organization that exists off tree complementary parts: the hardware, the software, and the community. their easy-to-handle softwares, can be used with any kind of hardware and thus allows all kinds of people to try out their ideas. the best approach to prototype electronics is go with an already built prototyping electronics board \u2013 we will use ESP32 Feather board (hardware) with Arduino (software). there is a think about languages here, there are very complex coding languages but we will try to keep it easy and use the arduino standard language for used for programmings of microcontrollers which is C and C++ a very helpful other tool are the arduino libraries libraries: (arduino) libraries are folders of existing codes that are shared, it is a way to organize and contribute to the coding-functions. exercise one - making music \u00b6 first things first. get the arduino (which is actually not an Arduino but a feather [board])to work. the hooking up to the system works somehow with the help of us all\u2026 the the right pins into the right holes. bueno, therefore I need to find the descriptions of the holes in the Adafruit ESP32 feather BECAAAUSE, it does not show on the thing itself\u2026 well having done this, I check the working of my code and its relation to my microcontroller\u2026 IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER HERE: choose the right port : in this case: \u201c/dev/cu.usbserial-0264F311\u201d and the right board : in this case: \u201cAdafruit ESP32 Feather\u201d ok well. with some simple codes (found in the arduino internet) I\u2019ll make it to sing some songs for me. e.g. pink panther(in a very queery high tone but whatever), happy birthday and some irrelevant other note-compositions. alright, to be honest, it is getting quite soon quite boring playing all the pre-set songs through copy paste and hitting enter. so I extetnt my Arduino\u2026 with a research on libraries\u2026 to include a new library, I open a new Arduino file, then in its menu bar I search for \u201cSketch\u201d and then Include Library > Manage Libraries . the mozzi library (nickname for Mozart???). from the GitHub page, I download via the code a zip file and follow the instructions to install it within my existing libraries. bueno thats done. yet nothing of the codes to adapt sonic output makes a sound \u2026 ?! trying my best to solve the wiring another nice application I would like to share here is our dear friend\u2019s birthday party. to avoid the typical party moment where everyone starts singing so loudly that they might drown out the others, we thought it would be nice to use our little music-making machiene instead. so we exposed the party guests to the queer sounds of the little featherboard.

Overall, the digital industry is a MESS \u2013 there has for a long time not been a sharing of files, a sharing of a same language. therefore, we have a lot of different programs and languages that are used. but nowadays, different CAD softwares can output standard models that can be read by many other softwares. talking about the basics of computing, the basics I should understand to design and print digitally on various axes. what makes a computer is the CPU and the GPU\u2026 CPU (central processing unit) very smart in doing heavy difficult mathematical equation, one after another: one operation that is very heavy and GPU (graphic processing unit) on the other hand is not so smart but can calculate a lot of small operations further vocabularies: Vector = a mathematical equation a geometric description of an image = it is one operation (read by CPU) No need for a lot of storage because what is being storage is just the equation Pixel = is a square, located in a x-y grid. One image is actually a lot of pixels that are being put together (read by GPU) \u2013 each pixel is made up of RGB sub-pixels\u2026 You need a lot of data because all the pixels in the raster have to be stored WHEN TO USE WHAT? a capturing device (camera for photo or movie) will always make pixel-raster. rather than when you 2D/ 3D-model, you always try to model in vector \u2013 why? because here we can enlarge and reduce the image in all directions infinitely (whereas if you zoom into pixels, at one point the pixels will show) SO to summarize: vectors are light files that can be enlarged and reduced without losing quality BUT often it needs to be translated into pixels so we can actually see it even more wordings: sRGB: color space of red, green and blue \u2013 currently the defined standard in the web. (1999 by HP and Microsoft) Adobe RGB space: especially suitable for editing high-quality images and photos for subsequent conversion to CMYK (CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW , BLACK that is used for printing the colors that computer screens display in RGB values) resolution: how many pixels define your image in horizontal and in vertical PPI: pixel per inch: 1 inch = 2,54 cm. So the PPI describe the amount of pixels in a 2,54 cm square. NURBS modelling (Non Uniform Rational B-Splines: defines vectors, we can built a surface through lines between points \u2013 curves. Control points in space that define shape \u2013 good for fluid shapes with a lot of complexity and at the same time easy to modify (through the points) CPU \u2013 you need a powerful CPU Mesh modelling: a collection of vertices (points in space), edges, and faces GPU \u2013 you just need a fast-pace operation tool able to handle a lot 3D scanners are always meshes, because they measure points and faces in the space Preferred modelling-method for manufacturing A story\u2026 that I must research. Historically, male persons where hunting behind mammoth and needed to orient themselves in space, the females were searching for fruit and nuts and needed to separate colors so they could define better healthy and nutritious food sources over those that are old and rotten. I am not so sure about that\u2026 ARE THESE TOOLS HELP US MODELLING FOR THE FUTURE? topology optimization (TO) is a mathematical method, a way to design with a set of rules (very complex mathematical equations) for a structural calculation. here, we start with a mass of material and take out everything that is not necessary Strong as possible by being light as possible. the goal here is to maximum force, minimal material, shortened design process what is topology? the term network topology refers to the arrangements, either physical or logical, of nodes and connections within a network \u201cTopology studies properties of spaces that are invariant under any continuous deformation. It is sometimes called \u201crubber-sheet geometry\u201d because the objects can be stretched and contracted like rubber, but cannot be broken. For example, a square can be deformed into a circle without breaking it, but a figure 8 cannot\u201d e.g. a highly opotimized frame of a motorbike will looke like full of holes: another method used in future design is: generative design where we start not from a design but from nothing. here, we let the computer make the design to propose the design; we set up parameters for the design-proceess and the program proposes a design process to design. algorithms are used here to set up the parameters e.g. all WeWork spaces are interior-designed with the aid of generative design to assure the best conditions for users this generative design is even more optimized than topology optimization . the results might be similar but the generative design is faster and consumes less resources (energy). what is a parametric design ? a parametric design is a type of design in which the shape, size, or other aspects of the design can be easily adjusted or modified by changing a set of parameters or variables. here, a design can be customized based on specific inputs or requirements (@grasshopper. this is made possible by using computer-aided design (CAD) software that allow you to specify a set of parameters and relationships between them as for example: Tinkercad: simple interface, variety of shapes and components Fusion 360: more advanced 3D design tool, robust set of features, great for creating complex designs OpenSCAD: open-source 3D modeling software that is primarily used for creating parametric designs, uses a script-based approach, which makes it great for creating repetitive shapes or objects exercise two - parametrizing a croissant \u00b6 parametrize means to describe or represent in terms of choosen variables (parameters) grasshopper for example is a parametric program that makes rhino models parametrically adaptable great, my handdrawing are quick and easily understandable. to get a grip on something digital, I play with grasshopper (in rhino) to translate my sketches into (possibly) a printed (for sure plantbased) edition of my croissant? closer into bidimensional (2D) fabrication \u00b6 with edu, josep, petra and others Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) what can you do with a laser cutter? it heats materials through directing high power through optics. various kinds of applying later-fabrications are: pressfit (hold the pieces together just by pressure), stacking, interlocking (waffle), living hinge (pure geometry that makes something hard very flexible), material welding, origami, electronics, what materials . does the laser handle? low density materials such as plastics, wood, cardboard, fabrics, in general all organic materials and (non-organic) plastics there are three (actually two) laser cutting processes Engrave (burning a lot of material next to each other) and Marking (burning a line of material) are actually the same - burning a bit if material cutting I always have to make a digital fabrication to get from CAD to CAM from laser cut to vinyl cut what is the difference? on a vinyl cutter, we dont have a x-y axis like in the laser cutte, here we have a right-left movement where the material is being applied onto. but here there exist other parameters we can adapt: speed, force, and durance of application. exercise three - lasercutting simulations \u00b6 somehow since the presentation of edu, the origami simulator really caught my eye. not that I am a great origami practitioner, its actually quite the opposite, I am very impatient and not precise at all, so the thought of folding tiny papers into tiny figures is not really appealing to be. but I love to watch them, hold them, see them beign folded. the origami-simulator is designed by an amanda who very helping explains how things work and offer some example files on her github page . yet to understand all of this, it took some time and to figure out, that files can be created and adapted in rhino to work in the simulator, took some more. to explain my experience in short, amanda has some example files that I downloaded and than imitated and adapted in variuos ways. the simulations then show how my rhino-drawing would fold and unfold if it would be paper. well not excactly, sometimes the simulation folds throgh and in if I out the simulations speed on very fast or somehow part just fly away, out of the screen sometimes as well. Well, i had some beautiful results playing around with exploding and colorcoding in various ways. and also then I lasercut and vinylprinted the sphere designs and in the end spend a lot of time folding paper\u2026 who had thought that would happen\u2026 I also use this newly learned skill in the challenge-week for the MOC with my team. on a more practical note, the online simulator reads SVGs in a certain way (File - Design Tips on the simulator (Mountain folds have red stroke - rgb(255, 0, 0), hex #ff0000; Valley folds have blue stroke - rgb(0, 0, 255), hex #0000ff; Boundary edges have black stroke - rgb(0, 0, 0), hex #000000). these rules are different to those I use during the the lasercuttring and the vinylprinting process. here I define the actions and allocate them to the colors of choice - so in the end, the colours I use for the simulation-SVGs are fine to. but its important to keep in mind that the simulation SVGs do not necessarily have the same color-codes as the rhino-files used for printing. about embedded codings (or how to use input and output sensors) \u00b6 with Victor how can all this codings and electronics in the end serve us? there is one project that started in the FabLab / MDEF environment some years ago which presents this very clearly - the smart citizen platform makes citizens use sensors to invesitgate their immediate environments (well still thats not a purspose but it might still as well as inspire some interests). so what we are talking about today is how to connect the elcetronic means in ways that we understand the information shown. meaning in other words to sense and input and make us observe and output as an example and excercies, we are playing with light sensors and try to code in a way so we know the amount (or strenght?) of the light, reaching the sensor. so in a way we can dimm the light once we would add a controll function. but for now it is just about setting up the featherboard in a way that a photo receptive sensor which receives light information (thus a light sensors ) and translates that into elecrticity that therefore gives another sign/ output (such as the lightening of an LED light or the making of a sound). so in the end we connect a LED and a button and a photo receptive sensor. then we make the light signal appeearing as a \u201cmorse code\u201d and connect the LED sensor with the photo recepting sensor. easy. no? exercise four - till the enlightment \u00b6 all of this works similar to the ghost machiene that we created last term. But yeah, that has been some time ago and the main coder here was definetely Amanda, without her the ghost would have remained unsensed forever. ok back to the basics. this lovely youtuber sets me back on track on how to arduino and how to LED - without sensor for now. Let make it blink for now\u2026 now I am working with the timing, in order to get acquaintance with the morse-code thingy\u2026 as my youtube Kylie shows me its actually not that difficult to implement. and here you have your puzzle, what am I communicating to you? I even made my syntax complex according to the international morse code one and not my simple youtube reference\u2026 and believe me or not, after few failures it works (proud) well, I guess now there is no postponing anymore. lets introduce the sensor, at least one is already plugged on my board, it cannot be so far from here. I already tried earlier with this example from arduino . But as often as I assembled my board anew and checked the code and the pins, it would not work for me. now I come back to it and figure out, that somehow on my board, I need to still wire the ground to he blue, the negative vein. well, thinking for oneself sometimes helps, just blindly copying never works it seems. so, here we are, since the beginning I just copied their image, now I linked the LED, the sensors and the transmitters with my own little mind. and siehe da\u2026 my LED shines bright. and when I put my finger on the sensor, it shines a little bit less bright. not yet so much, but it dimms the light I can see it! here even better, can you see it? well, I can so, the set up that works for me is this one, which is inspired f the official arduino one to its right okay, now I just somehow have to combine my morse-experience with the light-sensor output right? well, for another day, its night by now. int LED = 25; int unit = 200; // this is just according the the international morse code syntax to make it easier to write int dot = 200; // int dash = 600; // three units according to the inernational morsse code syntax int letterGap = 600; // seven units according to the inernational morsse code syntax int wordGap = 1400; // seven units according to the inernational morsse code syntax void setup() { // put your setup code here, to run once: pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); //make pin A3 output } void loop() { // put your main code here, to run repeatedly: switchLED(dash); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); delay(wordGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dash); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); delay(wordGap); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); switchLED(dash); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); delay(letterGap); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); switchLED(dot); } void switchLED(int timing) { digitalWrite(LED, LOW); delay (timing); digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); delay (timing); } ah and just f you wondered if you were right, reading my message\u2026 you were \u201cto all my heroes\u201d the first microchallenge \u00b6 in the first micro-challenge week we are asked to implement the skills we theorized so far about \u2026 like lasercutting and vinylprinting, parametrics and press fit designs, how to code arduino sensors and more. my personal work evolves around storytelling, making up spaces for voices to resonate in and miking up the circles people find themselves thinking with. as I am in the MDEF programm at the moment working with myrto 24/7, we decided to took the chance to step back from our togetherness and let ourselves go with tthe flow of some other ideas. Marielle and Carolina had already found each other and merged their POC-experience-frustrations into a concrete idea of working with the ignorance of white people towards the statues of colonizers and their histories in the city (BCN). in my theoretical thoughworld I am dealing a lot with (de)colonial practices and anyways, this means re-telling stories and giving voice, so I stepped in to become the white addative to our multiracial team. here you go, enjoy the presentation of the first micro challenge . about 3D fabrication and scanning \u00b6 with Edu 3D printing \u00b6 What options exist in 3D production? Additive manufacturing technologies: Working with Metal: DMLS (direct metal laser sintering) / SLM (selective laser melting) / DMP (direct metal printing) Working with resin: SLA (stereolithography) Specific machine that works with paper LOM (laminated object manufacturing - almost unknown) paper printer with a cut out and then millions of layers on top oof each other. Used for aesthetics reasons because you can get very high resolution outcomes Subtractive manufacturing technologies: CNC machining (computerized numerical control): It is a computerized manufacturing process in which pre-programmed software and code controls the movement of production equipment (ex. mills, lathes, routers, grinders and lasers) More about the history of 3D printing I already describe here . But the essentials again: the 3D printer bible . Subtractive vs additive comparison The workflow with 3D printings\u2026 First we need a 3D model (exactly) Then we have the slicer settings - we need to slice our model into horizontal pieces (Slicing STTL file) Then we have the printer limitations and the material that we can use (data) Built your 3D model as a bone \u2013 a shell and a infill, to safe material and to allow for faster production (printing) Structural strength often comes with less material that are designed in complex dimensionals The most classic ones are: rectangular, triangular or diagrid, wiggle and honeycomb. We can change the structural strength of an object by adapting, changing its infill - here the goal is to make the material more isotropic. Isotropic: having a physical property which has the same value when measured in different directions vs. Anisotropic: exhibiting properties with different values when measured in different directions. What we will use withing FabLab? FDM (fused deposition modeling) a 3D printing machine Two versions: 1. direct driven \u2013 direct driven machine are better but slower, here, the motor is directly at the nosel. You can only print hard materials, not flexible ones 2. Bowden driven \u2013 these machines have a cord to allow the nosel to move farther away 3D scanning \u00b6 What is 3D scanning as a concept? Being able to represent the real world in a digital environment \u2013 3D scanning built on all the experiences humanity has made up to capture reality (painting, camera obscura\u2026) how to draw geometrics? Emergence of mathematical solutions with trigonometric (math) \u2013 setting up rules for distances and spaces. Nowadays, 3Dd scanning works by pure geometry and trigonometry. google Earth uses 3D scanner with satellites and airplanes. What is nerve modeling? Vector interpolations \u2013 how the lines are interconnected. What is mesh modelling? Points located in the space. With a 3D scanner we are calculating the points in the space \u2013 reading the mesh. Not the nerves. Different 3D print techniques\u2026 SLS scanner (Structured light scanners) \u2013 extremely accurate and offer high resolution. They can be very fast. They use cameras and expose a lot of light, therefore they are not good to use to scan humans (bad for eyes\u2026) Downside, you have to rotate you object yourself in the machine Laser scanner \u2013 similar concept as the SLS but most f the time handheld \u2013 so you can move it around the object. This cannot scan colors but only shapes. LiDAR scanner \u2013 also a laser but works with a different concept: Time of Flight. We use the time the light takes to travel to the object and to be bounced back from the object -we measure the distances. We have a laser-pointer and we move and project the laser onto the object. Downside, you cannot scan far with accuracy. With LiDAR we can scan terrains, topographic maps. Because of the interplay between sunlight on plants and the laser (too fast and complex for me to understand completely but still very interesting) the leaves are invisible to the laser camera and thus one can capture whole environments/ forests\u2026 and make topographic analysis. Digiprobe scanner \u2013 it is a switch, we have a pen with a switch and wen we touch the switch, it stores the value of the location. Touch digi \u2013 with this pen you can decide exactly which parts of an object you want to scan, capture. With this you can check specific parts. This is a CNM machine (manually able to decide where to put the pen) Sometimes you spray your objects before scanning them via photogrammetry. Photogrammetry relies on computer exercise five - the croissant becomes tangible (maybe) \u00b6 to come back to my vegan croissants (on which the grasshoppers are munching) I export my rhino file as obj and upload it into the ultimaker cura . looks magnificent, a black croissant\u2026 then I put some setting because my croissant it quite floating in the air, it needs a support structure (I let cura generate how and what\u2019s important here). Then I slice it up, cura tells me it will take 19 hours to print\u2026 in order to reduce that time, I scale down my objects. it is gonna be a tiny croissant, 50 mm (perfect size for grasshoppers I think). furthermore I reduce the density of the object and the support structure. okay, I slice it anew, 2,5 hours. that fine. I guess. to the 3D printer\u2026 I set up the 3D printer, by heating up the nosel to insert my material (PML) - I want the most simple easy ging one because this is just a trial print in order to print (whatever sense in here? I am still figuring out). so once the PML-threat is loaded, I upload my cura -file onto the SD-card of the printer, insert it back into the printer and press print croissant. I come back after a nice session of bouldering and unfortunately find out that my croisssant did not even make it to the baking point\u2026 Amanda (my hero) hints me towards adding a raft - a plate adhesion which is essentially a plate ontop of which the support and the croissant can be built onto because according to Amanda, the structure had to little hold on the slippery plate of the 3D printer. okay, so I edit my settings and built a plate addhesion as a raft. reduce its density in order to safe time and slice it up in cura . about three hours it calculates. bueno, I set the SD-card and printer, press print and leave it printing over night\u2026 excited to come in the morning and yes, in the morning, freshly baked, I am finding my croissant very sticked to the plate of the printer. Edu explains me, that a he hasnt been ussing rafts since years. rafts are for very complicated models, my little croissant definetely isnt. however, heaing up the bed a little helps me to sratch it off and then I break off the support and here e voila, the croissant is there. about networking \u00b6 with Victor the internet \u2013 a copy machine? actually what it does is just copying information (bits) from one place to another. Location: it is not possible to perform all processing/calculation orr hardware management tasks in the same site \u2013 four knot points on the world where all data are flowing through. Parallelism: you can do, process multiple things at the same time Modularity: about systems and distribution of humans, make developments in modules, each with a very specific function, easily scalable and more easily repairable Access: human acccess to data from all computers wherever they are The cloud does not exist, only hard drives on other people computers. Dissociation between what\u2019s happening here in reality and in the digital reality There is a (real) network . the physical layer / manifestation of the transmission of information / data and there are *protocol*s \u2013 agreement on how networks are communicating. A set of rules of who can speak at what time. We have physical layers and nonphysical rules. My conversation with ChatGPT An internet node, also known as a network node or internet exchange point, is a physical location where internet service providers (ISPs), content providers, and other networks interconnect to exchange internet traffic. It is difficult to provide an exact number of internet nodes worldwide since the number is constantly changing and evolving. However, there are many internet node directories available online that list various internet nodes around the world. One of the largest internet node directories is PeeringDB , which currently lists over 9,000 network operators and over 8,000 peering locations around the world. Internet nodes can be found in major cities and metropolitan areas worldwide. Some of the largest internet exchange points in terms of traffic volume include the AMS-IX in Amsterdam, the DE-CIX in Frankfurt, the LINX in London, the Equinix IX in Ashburn, Virginia, and the China Telecom CNIX in Beijing. It\u2019s worth noting that the number and location of internet nodes can change over time as new networks emerge, and existing networks expand or contract. network topologies from centralization to distributed hubs - networks of networks adressess redirecting to adressess redirecting to adressses wired vs. wireless communication wired: you need physical stuff (copper, aluminium) to sent electric signals. because cmoputers are faster than what cables can transmitt, there are parallel ports that take in a lot of cables parallely and serial ports that take series of data (USB = universal serial bus) Parallel interfaces transfer multiple bits at the same time. They usually require buses of data - transmitting across eight, sixteen, or more wires. This means that waves of data can be sent, with high speeds, but with a lot of wires. On the contrary, serial interfaces stream their data with a reference signal, one single bit at a time. These interfaces can operate on as little as one wire, usually never more than four wireless: over the air communication (OTA) of data - here, use the different various frequencies of signals (@radio frequency spectrum ranges) am (amplitude modulation) fm (frequency modulation) what it the difference with AM radio, the amplitude, or overall strength, of the signal is varied to incorporate the sound information. with FM, the frequency (the number of times each second that the current changes direction) of the carrier signal is varied. exercise six - a MDEF internal whatsap \u00b6 we are all using the same broker (laptop of victor) about how to make simple things complex (an LED) \u00b6 or on Interfaces: machine vs machine with Edu and Oscar what can we do with a simple LED ? why would we? oscar makes us enthiusastic telling us how he collaborates with dance companies. Here is Hackmd excercise seven - blinkin with complexities \u00b6 1.0 blink \u00b6 simply, make it blink. the code for 1.0 blink: /* Blink Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly. */ // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board #define LED 14 //int LED = 14; practically these two have the same output put they come to the result in different ways. void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. pinMode(LED, OUTPUT); } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { digitalWrite(LED, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second } 2.0 blink by command \u00b6 great next. Now we gonna write a code to ask for constent, we want to be asked before the LED is starting to blink. in order to do so, we are using the serial monitor and tell the arduino to do something only in the moment we tell him. it is like a chat between me and the arduino, with the serial monitor as out communication platform. how do we do that? we write a code and the open the serial monitor, and write in there the commant blink and (according to what we coded), my arduino will excecute the command - and will blink. 2.0 blink by command. first it does not work. Our internal communication (the serial monitor) does not respond to my commands. Oscar explains that I need to set up the serial monitor in technical term so that the USB connection does understand. Instead of the new line I change the settings to both NL & CR and the set to 9600 baud . Now, I works, if I say blink , my arduino blinks. serial.begins = is the communicaion with the USB (universal serial bus). So the speed (in brackets) has to be aliigned between the arduino and our featherboard. now it works, if I say blink fast , tthe arduino blinks fast (because I created a hopping function ). the code for 2.0 blink by command: #include \"Arduino.h\" #define LED_PIN 14 // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT); Serial.begin(9600); } void blink () { digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(1000); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(1000); // wait for a second } void hopping () { digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // turn the LED on (HIGH is the voltage level) delay(100); // wait for a second digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // turn the LED off by making the voltage LOW delay(100); } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { if (Serial.available()) { String newMsg = Serial.readString(); newMsg.trim(); Serial.print(\"Got new message!: \"); Serial.println(newMsg); // blink if we tell it to! if (newMsg.equals(\"blink\")){ blink(); } if (newMsg.equals(\"blink fast\")){ hopping(); } } } now, this is very inefficient, our code has a lot of lines and will probably only grow till the point that it is so heavy the featherboard cannot hold it anymore and the arduino function does not work. so we are now working toward fully parametrizing our functions as much as possisble\u2026 3.0 blink and breathe \u00b6 working with a jled library to make our LED breathe (slowly dimming on and dimming off) the code for 3.0 blink and breathe: #include \"Arduino.h\" #include \"jled.h\" #define LED_PIN 14 // the setup function runs once when you press reset or power the board void setup() { // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output. Serial.begin(9600); } // Jled object. // More information here: https://github.com/jandelgado/jled#usage JLed led = JLed(LED_PIN); // Basic blink void blink () { led.Blink(1000, 600).Repeat(3); } // Smooth breathing void breathe() { led.Breathe(1000).Repeat(3); } // the loop function runs over and over again forever void loop() { if (Serial.available()) { // Read the string and clean it up String newMsg = Serial.readString(); newMsg.trim(); // For debugging purposes, print it Serial.print(\"Got new message!: \"); Serial.println(newMsg); // Blink if we tell it to! if (newMsg.equals(\"blink\")){ blink(); // Or breathe! } else if (newMsg.equals(\"breathe\")) { breathe(); } } // Do not remove this line! led.Update(); } 4.0 blinking over the network \u00b6 like we tried last week with victor, we are using the MQTT (a protocol that is used in a lot of internet of thing - IOT devices) which is used for us to trigger to sensors and allows us to listen the output. instead of relying on a cable, we talk via the wifi network existing and we listen all together to the same things. in this case it means we are commanding either breathe or blink and all featherboards in class (that managed to connect the wifi-code in their arduino) will see their LEDs lighting up. what needs to be done: defining the wifi network (we/oour featherboards are all connected to) and our name/our featherboaords name\u2026 the code for 4.0 blinking over the network: #include \"jled.h\" #define LED_PIN 14 // New code for MQTT! //------------------- #include <WiFi.h> #include <PubSubClient.h> const char* ssid = \"Iaac-Wifi\"; const char* password = \"EnterIaac22@\"; WiFiClient wifiClient; const char* mqttBroker = \"mqtt-staging.smartcitizen.me\"; const char* mqttClientName = \"s&c\"; const char* mqttClientUser = \"fablabbcn102\"; const char* mqttClientPass = \"\"; const char* topicToSub = \"lab\"; // const char* topicToPub = \"lab\"; PubSubClient mqttClient(wifiClient); //------------------- // Jled object. // More information here: https://github.com/jandelgado/jled#usage JLed led = JLed(LED_PIN); //------------------- // Add more animations here! // Basic blink void blink () { led.Blink(1000, 600).Repeat(3); } // Smooth breathing void breathe() { led.Breathe(1000).Repeat(3); } //------------------- void mqttConnect() { while (!mqttClient.connected()) { Serial.print(\"Attempting MQTT connection...\"); if (mqttClient.connect(mqttClientName, mqttClientUser, mqttClientPass)) { Serial.println(\"connected\"); mqttClient.publish(\"hello\", mqttClientName); // Topic(s) subscription mqttClient.subscribe(topicToSub); } else { Serial.print(\"failed, rc=\"); Serial.print(mqttClient.state()); Serial.println(\" try again in 5 seconds\"); delay(5000); } } } void callback(char* topic, byte* message, unsigned int length) { String newMsg; for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) { newMsg += (char)message[i]; } Serial.print(\"Message arrived on topic: \"); Serial.print(topic); Serial.print(\".

CNC can mill in various ways: with a 3-axis CNC: type of milling where the cutting tool moves along three axes (X, Y, and Z) to remove material from the workpiece. can be done with either a milling machine or a turning machine. or with multi-axis CNC: type of milling that uses machines with more than four or five axiss to achieve greater precision and complexity in the machined part. three subtypes: indexed milling: cutting tool moves along multiple fixed positions to achieve complex shapes continuous milling: the cutting tool moves along a continuous path to achieve smooth surfaces and complex contours mill-turning: a single machine combines the functions of both milling and turning to achieve complex shapes in a single setup another category, a handheld/guided machine. this one can not be automated completely but it allows for manual works and helps. this machine is only as accurrate, as you, the user are. (only for planar cuts - not very handy for 3 dimensional or very detailed works) what are the parts of the CNC? T-Slot Table: Provides a stable surface for holding the workpiece. Spindle: Rotates the cutting tool and feeds it into the workpiece to remove material. Bridge: Connects the X and Y-axis components and provides stability to the machine. Steppers: Move the cutting tool along the X, Y, and Z-axis with high precision. Cable Carrier: Protects and organizes the electrical cables that run between the machine components. when using the CNC it is important to respect some safety rules. the CNC cuts out which means that material will be turned into dustt and chips and will fly around in the air. depending on the material used, this implies some issues such as health threats, inflamability\u2026 how to design for the CNC entonces? they call this process (because everything needs acronyms) CNC DFM (Design for Manufacturing) these 50 digital joint poster is Edu\u2019s bible excercise eight - \u00b6 hello","title":"digital prototyping"},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#_1","text":"\ud83d\uddd3 Week 14 / 01 February - 2023 prototyping for design with Edu, Victor, Santi, Josep, Aida and Petra (somehow) unexpectadly this course turned out to be a series of intense lectures with subsequent (self-)explorative adapation trials. theoretically we are introduced to the huge fields of advanced manufacturing, rapid prototyping and other new design methodologies by victor and edu that really did their best to hold us up motivated. we are very much encouraged to play around with the various tools accessible to us and make up some (hands-on? - the computer) experiences with digital fabrication tools. when we come to the micro-challenge-week we actually explorer what it means to physicalize digital realities\u2026","title":""},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#about-electronics-and-codings","text":"with Victor with victor we party continued our conversation of transparentizing blackboxes we started off last term. similarly in in the coding world, a lot of things are kept in the dark and made complicated so users use user-oriented-design products that prevent individual agency through mystifying easy things. arduino is one of these projects that work for a transparent electronics as they aim to make coding more accessible to public and are all in for collective knowledges. we often consider Arduino being the wired-board that allows us to physicalize our codes yet actually arduino is a small organization that exists off tree complementary parts: the hardware, the software, and the community. their easy-to-handle softwares, can be used with any kind of hardware and thus allows all kinds of people to try out their ideas. the best approach to prototype electronics is go with an already built prototyping electronics board \u2013 we will use ESP32 Feather board (hardware) with Arduino (software). there is a think about languages here, there are very complex coding languages but we will try to keep it easy and use the arduino standard language for used for programmings of microcontrollers which is C and C++ a very helpful other tool are the arduino libraries libraries: (arduino) libraries are folders of existing codes that are shared, it is a way to organize and contribute to the coding-functions.","title":"about electronics and codings"},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#exercise-one-making-music","text":"first things first. get the arduino (which is actually not an Arduino but a feather [board])to work. the hooking up to the system works somehow with the help of us all\u2026 the the right pins into the right holes. bueno, therefore I need to find the descriptions of the holes in the Adafruit ESP32 feather BECAAAUSE, it does not show on the thing itself\u2026 well having done this, I check the working of my code and its relation to my microcontroller\u2026 IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER HERE: choose the right port : in this case: \u201c/dev/cu.usbserial-0264F311\u201d and the right board : in this case: \u201cAdafruit ESP32 Feather\u201d ok well. with some simple codes (found in the arduino internet) I\u2019ll make it to sing some songs for me. e.g. pink panther(in a very queery high tone but whatever), happy birthday and some irrelevant other note-compositions. alright, to be honest, it is getting quite soon quite boring playing all the pre-set songs through copy paste and hitting enter. so I extetnt my Arduino\u2026 with a research on libraries\u2026 to include a new library, I open a new Arduino file, then in its menu bar I search for \u201cSketch\u201d and then Include Library > Manage Libraries . the mozzi library (nickname for Mozart???). from the GitHub page, I download via the code a zip file and follow the instructions to install it within my existing libraries. bueno thats done. yet nothing of the codes to adapt sonic output makes a sound \u2026 ?! trying my best to solve the wiring another nice application I would like to share here is our dear friend\u2019s birthday party. to avoid the typical party moment where everyone starts singing so loudly that they might drown out the others, we thought it would be nice to use our little music-making machiene instead. so we exposed the party guests to the queer sounds of the little featherboard.

Overall, the digital industry is a MESS \u2013 there has for a long time not been a sharing of files, a sharing of a same language. therefore, we have a lot of different programs and languages that are used. but nowadays, different CAD softwares can output standard models that can be read by many other softwares. talking about the basics of computing, the basics I should understand to design and print digitally on various axes. what makes a computer is the CPU and the GPU\u2026 CPU (central processing unit) very smart in doing heavy difficult mathematical equation, one after another: one operation that is very heavy and GPU (graphic processing unit) on the other hand is not so smart but can calculate a lot of small operations further vocabularies: Vector = a mathematical equation a geometric description of an image = it is one operation (read by CPU) No need for a lot of storage because what is being storage is just the equation Pixel = is a square, located in a x-y grid.

(1999 by HP and Microsoft) Adobe RGB space: especially suitable for editing high-quality images and photos for subsequent conversion to CMYK (CYAN, MAGENTA, YELLOW , BLACK that is used for printing the colors that computer screens display in RGB values) resolution: how many pixels define your image in horizontal and in vertical PPI: pixel per inch: 1 inch = 2,54 cm.

It is sometimes called \u201crubber-sheet geometry\u201d because the objects can be stretched and contracted like rubber, but cannot be broken. For example, a square can be deformed into a circle without breaking it, but a figure 8 cannot\u201d e.g. a highly opotimized frame of a motorbike will looke like full of holes: another method used in future design is: generative design where we start not from a design but from nothing. here, we let the computer make the design to propose the design; we set up parameters for the design-proceess and the program proposes a design process to design. algorithms are used here to set up the parameters e.g. all WeWork spaces are interior-designed with the aid of generative design to assure the best conditions for users this generative design is even more optimized than topology optimization . the results might be similar but the generative design is faster and consumes less resources (energy). what is a parametric design ? a parametric design is a type of design in which the shape, size, or other aspects of the design can be easily adjusted or modified by changing a set of parameters or variables. here, a design can be customized based on specific inputs or requirements (@grasshopper. this is made possible by using computer-aided design (CAD) software that allow you to specify a set of parameters and relationships between them as for example: Tinkercad: simple interface, variety of shapes and components Fusion 360: more advanced 3D design tool, robust set of features, great for creating complex designs OpenSCAD: open-source 3D modeling software that is primarily used for creating parametric designs, uses a script-based approach, which makes it great for creating repetitive shapes or objects","title":"about the basic design tools"},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#exercise-two-parametrizing-a-croissant","text":"parametrize means to describe or represent in terms of choosen variables (parameters) grasshopper for example is a parametric program that makes rhino models parametrically adaptable great, my handdrawing are quick and easily understandable. to get a grip on something digital, I play with grasshopper (in rhino) to translate my sketches into (possibly) a printed (for sure plantbased) edition of my croissant?","title":"exercise two - parametrizing a croissant"},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#closer-into-bidimensional-2d-fabrication","text":"with edu, josep, petra and others Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation (LASER) what can you do with a laser cutter? it heats materials through directing high power through optics. various kinds of applying later-fabrications are: pressfit (hold the pieces together just by pressure), stacking, interlocking (waffle), living hinge (pure geometry that makes something hard very flexible), material welding, origami, electronics, what materials . does the laser handle? low density materials such as plastics, wood, cardboard, fabrics, in general all organic materials and (non-organic) plastics there are three (actually two) laser cutting processes Engrave (burning a lot of material next to each other) and Marking (burning a line of material) are actually the same - burning a bit if material cutting I always have to make a digital fabrication to get from CAD to CAM from laser cut to vinyl cut what is the difference? on a vinyl cutter, we dont have a x-y axis like in the laser cutte, here we have a right-left movement where the material is being applied onto. but here there exist other parameters we can adapt: speed, force, and durance of application.","title":"closer into bidimensional (2D) fabrication"},{"location":"term2/prototyping/notes/#exercise-three-lasercutting-simulations","text":"somehow since the presentation of edu, the origami simulator really caught my eye. not that I am a great origami practitioner, its actually quite the opposite, I am very impatient and not precise at all, so the thought of folding tiny papers into tiny figures is not really appealing to be. but I love to watch them, hold them, see them beign folded. the origami-simulator is designed by an amanda who very helping explains how things work and offer some example files on her github page . yet to understand all of this, it took some time and to figure out, that files can be created and adapted in rhino to work in the simulator, took some more. to explain my experience in short, amanda has some example files that I downloaded and than imitated and adapted in variuos ways. the simulations then show how my rhino-drawing would fold and unfold if it would be paper. well not excactly, sometimes the simulation folds throgh and in if I out the simulations speed on very fast or somehow part just fly away, out of the screen sometimes as well.

CNC can mill in various ways: with a 3-axis CNC: type of milling where the cutting tool moves along three axes (X, Y, and Z) to remove material from the workpiece. can be done with either a milling machine or a turning machine. or with multi-axis CNC: type of milling that uses machines with more than four or five axiss to achieve greater precision and complexity in the machined part. three subtypes: indexed milling: cutting tool moves along multiple fixed positions to achieve complex shapes continuous milling: the cutting tool moves along a continuous path to achieve smooth surfaces and complex contours mill-turning: a single machine combines the functions of both milling and turning to achieve complex shapes in a single setup another category, a handheld/guided machine. this one can not be automated completely but it allows for manual works and helps. this machine is only as accurrate, as you, the user are.
